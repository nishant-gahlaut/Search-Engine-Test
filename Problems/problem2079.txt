They found out that one of the Horcrux is located at The Lestrange Vault. But You-Know-Who has locked the vault with a dark spell.\nFortunately, the password to the vault can be found out by solving a problem. But they were not able to solve the problem and hence need help from Chef. Since Chef is quite busy, he has delegated this task to you.\nYou are given an array of N elements. MEX of a set is defined as the minimum non-negative integer that doesn't exist in it. For example, the MEX of the set {0,\xe2\x80\x892,\xe2\x80\x894} is 1 and the MEX of the set {1,\xe2\x80\x892,\xe2\x80\x893} is 0. Note that the MEX of empty set will be 0.\nSimilar to Expected value, let's define Cheftated value, C[Y] of a random variable Y as follows:\n\nwhere Y is a random variable with a finite number of outcomes y1, y2, ..... , ya occurring with probabilities p1, p2, ..... , pa. Take 00 = 1.\n\nYou are given an array A consisting of N non-negative integers. Your task is to calculate the cheftated value of base K xor sum of MEX values of X randomly selected subsequences( repetitions allowed) of A.\nCheftated value can always be represented as an irreducible fraction P/Q such that gcd(Q, 330301441) = 1, i.e. Q-1 ( multiplicative inverse) modulo 330301441 exists. You have to print the value P * Q-1 modulo 330301441. Please see the sample explanation for more details.\nAlso, xor-sum in base K (xork) can be perfomed by representing the numbers in base K and adding each digit in base K( without carrying forward), e.g. xorsum of 6 and 9 in base 5 is equal to 115 xor5 145 = 205, i.e. the number 10.\n\nInput\nFirst line of the input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases. \nFirst line of each test case contains three space separated integers N, K and X.\nSecond line of each test case contains N space separated integers, i-th of which is Ai denoting the ith element of the array.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a line containing single integer representing the value of P*Q-1 modulo 330301441.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 X \xe2\x89\xa4 1018\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (15 points) : K \xe2\x89\xa4 3\nSubtask #2 (15 points) : N \xe2\x89\xa4 103\nSubtask #3 (70 points) : Original constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 2 2\n1 0 2\n4 4 4\n4 0 1 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n87392358\n88861416\n\n\nExplanation\n\nExample case 1: \nLet's name the sub-sequences  as A = [], B = [1], C = [0], D = [2], E = [1, 0], F = [1, 2], G = [0, 2], H = [1, 0, 2].\nPossible outcome of xor values after selecting two sub-sequences (repetitions allowed):\n\n0 when you select (two from (A, B, D, F)) or (two from (C, G)) or (two from (E)) or (two from (H)) making it 22 ways.\n1 when you select (one from (A, B, D, F) and one from (C, G)) or (one from (E) and one from (H)) making it 18 ways.\n2 when you select (one from (A, B, D, F) and one from (E)) or (one from (H) and one from (C, G)) making it 12 ways.\n3 when you select (one from (A, B, D, F) and one from (H)) or (one from (E) and one from (C, G)) making it 12 ways.\n\nCheftated value = 02*0 * (22/64)3*0 + 12*1 * (18/64)3*1 + 22*2 * (12/64)3*2 + 32*3 * (12/64)3*3 = 70310425195/68719476736.\nAnswer to print = 70310425195 * 68719476736-1 mod 330301441 = 87392358\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85adkroxx\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85alex_2oo8\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/XORTREEH\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 adkroxx, binary-exponentation, fast-fourier-transform, hard, number-theoretic-transfmtn, oct17\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3019\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-08-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
