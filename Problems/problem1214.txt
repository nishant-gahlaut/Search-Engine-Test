b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a sequence of integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. He takes a sheet of paper and for each non-empty subsequence B of this sequence, he does the following:\n\nFor each integer which appears in B, count its number of occurrences in the sequence B.\nChoose the integer with the largest number of occurrences. If there are several options, choose the smallest one.\nFinally, write down the chosen integer (an element of B) on the sheet of paper.\n\nFor each integer between 1 and N inclusive, find out how many times it appears on Chef's sheet of paper. Since these numbers may be very large, compute them modulo 1,000,000,007 (109+7).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers should be the number of occurrences of i on Chef's sheet of paper.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 500,000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5,000\nSubtask #2 (10 points): A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN is a permutation of the integers 1 through N\nSubtask #3 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n2 2 3\n2\n1 2\n3\n1 2 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0 6 1\n2 1\n3 4 0\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 3: There are 7 non-empty subsequences:\n\n[1] (Chef writes down 1)\n[2] (Chef writes down 2)\n[2] (Chef writes down 2)\n[1,2] (Chef writes down 1)\n[1,2] (Chef writes down 1)\n[2,2] (Chef writes down 2)\n[1,2,2] (Chef writes down 2)\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85bthero\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SUBSFREQ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Frequency Arrays, Combinatorics, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Sorting, Observation, Subsequence\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Mathematics, Algorithms, Groupings\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2357\n\n\nDate Added:\n3-05-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
