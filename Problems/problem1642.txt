b'\nYou are given a convex polygon PP with N vertices. The vertices (in clockwise order) are v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6vN. The coordinates of vi are (xi,yi). All vertices have integer coordinates.\nA diagonal of P is a line segment l joining two distinct vertices vi and vj of P, such that l is not already an edge of P. Every diagonal of P splits it into two smaller convex polygons, both having positive areas.\nThe evenness of a diagonal of P is the minimum of the areas of the two parts obtained when the polygon P is cut along this diagonal.\nLet S be the sum of the evenness of all diagonals of P. \nFind the value of 2S(mod998244353). \nIt can be shown that for all polygons P with integer coordinates, the value 2S is an integer.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer N, the number of vertices of the convex polygon P. This is followed by N lines describing the points of the convex polygon, in clockwise order.\nThe ith subsequent line contains two space-separated integers, xi,yi \xe2\x80\x94 the coordinates of vi.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a new line with a single integer, the answer as per the problem statement.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nThe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\nThe given polygon P is convex\nEvery coordinate is an integer whose absolute value does not exceed 108\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 ( 5 points): Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 500\nSubtask #2 (15 points): Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2000\nSubtask #3 (80 points): Original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n4\n-1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 -1\n4\n-100000 0\n0 100000\n100000 0\n0 -100000\n3\n0 0\n0 1\n1 0\n5\n-87260 82619\n-59348 68595\n86583 -16668\n85637 -45559\n-49307 -31316\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n70225880\n0\n667956140\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: The given polygon is a square with side length \xe2\x88\x9a2. There are only two diagonals, both are identical and split the polygon equally into two halves each with area (\xe2\x88\x9a2)22=1.\nThus S=min(1,1)+min(1,1)=2. The value of 2S(mod998244353) is thus 4.\nTest case 2: The given polygon is identical to the previous case, except that all coordinates are multiplied by 105. Therefore the given sum gets multiplied by (105)2. Make sure you output the sum modulo 998244353. Here 2S=4\xe2\x8b\x851010 and 4\xe2\x8b\x851010(mod998244353)=70225880.\nTest case 3: There are no diagonals in this polygon, and so the answer is 0.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsrikkanth_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PLYARSM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 convex-hull, feb222, medium, pre-computation, srikkanth_adm, two-pointers\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2904\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-01-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
