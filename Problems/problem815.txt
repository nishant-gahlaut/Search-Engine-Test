b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nMike is fond of collecting stamps. He has a lot of rare and unusual ones in his collection. Unfortunately, a few days ago he was fired from his well-paid job.\nBut he doesn't complain about that, he acts! That's why Mike picked up N stamps from his collection and is going to sell them. He has already placed an announcement on the Internet and got M offers. Each offer can be described as a set of stamps, that the buyer wants to buy. Now Mike needs your help to choose a set of offers, that he should accept. \nHe can't accept offers partially. Also, as far as Mike has the only copy of each stamp, he can sell one stamp to at most one buyer.\nOf course, Mike wants to maximize the number of accepted offers. Help him!\n\nInput\n \nThe first line contains two integer N and M, denoting the number of the stamps and the number of the offers.\nThe next M lines contain the descriptions of the offers. The (i+1)'th line of the input contains the description of the i'th offer and corresponds to the following pattern: Ki Ai,  1 Ai,  2, ..., Ai,     Ki. Ki - is the number of the stamps, which the i'th buyer wants to buy, Ai - is the list of the stamps sorted in the ascending order.\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nOutput should contain the only integer, denoting the maximal number of the offers, that Mike can accept.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 20,000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 20\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ki\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4 3\n2 1 2\n2 2 3\n2 3 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the example test Mike should accept the first and the third offer.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kostya_by\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MIKE3\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bit Manipulation, Basic Maths, Recursion, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1903\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-01-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
