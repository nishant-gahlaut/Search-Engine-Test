b'\nGiven a set of N integer points on the Cartesian plane. Your task is to find an integer point satisfying its sum of distances to N given points (S) is minimum.\n\nInput\nThere are several test cases (fifteen at most), each formed as follows:\nThe first line contains a positive integer N (N \xe2\x89\xa4 2,000).\nN lines follow, each containing a pair of integers (each having an absolute value of 109 at most) describing coordinates of a given point.\n\nThe input is ended with N = 0.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output on a line a real number (with exactly 6 decimal places) which is the respective minimum sum S found.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n5\n1 4\n2 3\n5 2\n3 5\n4 1\n0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2.828427\n9.640986\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nanhdq_adm\n\n\nTester:\n4\xe2\x98\x85rajivka\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CPOINT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 anhdq_adm, april11, easy\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1951\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-03-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2.7551 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
