b'\nChef is given a contract to build towers in Chefland which are made by stacking blocks one above the other. Initially, there is only 11 block in the inventory and no tower has been built. Chef follows the following 22 steps in each operation:\n\nEither build a new tower or update an existing tower that has been built in previous operations using any number of blocks currently present in the inventory. After this step, the size of the inventory reduces by the number of blocks used.\nSuppose the tower Chef updated or built has BB blocks after the step, Chef gets to add BB new blocks to the inventory as a reward.\n\nFind the maximum number of towers of height XX that Chef can build in MM operations.\nNote: Tower of height XX means that the tower consists of XX blocks placed one above the other.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case contains a single line of input, two space separated integers X,MX,M.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output a single integer, the maximum number of towers that Chef can build.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4109\n0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa410170\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41017\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n2 1\n2 2\n2 3\n53 7\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Cases 11, 22 and 33:\n\nOperation 11: \nRemove 11 block from the inventory and build a new tower of height 11 after which the inventory becomes empty. \nAdd 11 block to the inventory after which the inventory has only 11 block.\nOperation 22: \nRemove 11 block from the inventory and update the tower of height 11 to 1+1=21+1=2 after which the inventory becomes empty.\nAdd 22 blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has only 22 blocks.\nOperation 33:\nRemove 22 blocks from the inventory and build a new tower of height 22 after which the inventory becomes empty.\nAdd 22 blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has only 22 blocks.\n\nSo after operation 11, there is no tower of height 22 built, after operation 22, there is a single tower of height 22 built and after operation 33, 22 towers of height 22 are built.\nTest Case 44:\n\nOperation 11: \nRemove 11 block from the inventory and build a new tower of height 11 after which the inventory becomes empty. \nAdd 11 block to the inventory after which the inventory has only 11 block.\nOperation 22: \nRemove 11 block from the inventory and update the tower of height 11 to 1+1=21+1=2 after which the inventory becomes empty.\nAdd 22 blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has only 22 blocks.\nOperation 33: \nRemove 22 blocks from the inventory and update the tower of height 22 to 2+2=42+2=4 after which the inventory becomes empty.\nAdd 44 blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has only 44 blocks.\nOperation 44: \nRemove 44 blocks from the inventory and update the tower of height 44 to 4+4=84+4=8 after which the inventory becomes empty.\nAdd 88 blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has only 88 blocks.\nOperation 55: \nRemove 88 blocks from the inventory and update the tower of height 88 to 8+8=168+8=16 after which the inventory becomes empty.\nAdd 1616 blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has only 1616 blocks.\nOperation 66: \nRemove 1616 blocks from the inventory and update the tower of height 1616 to 16+16=3216+16=32 after which the inventory becomes empty.\nAdd 3232 blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has only 3232 blocks.\nOperation 77: \nRemove 2121 blocks from the inventory and update the tower of height 3232 to 32+21=5332+21=53 after which the inventory has 32\xe2\x88\x9221=1132\xe2\x88\x9221=11 blocks remaining.\nAdd 5353 blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has 53+11=6453+11=64 blocks in total.\n\nSo after 7th7th operation we are able to achieve one tower of height 5353.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85prakhar_87\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TOWERTOP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, prakhar_87, start25\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1693\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-01-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
