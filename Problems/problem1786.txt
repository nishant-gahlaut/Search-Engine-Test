b'\nSanta wants to give some gifts to Chef.\nSo Santa told Chef that choose a number(N) and drop that number in a shocks and Santa will give gifts according to that number.\nSanta decided that he will form a string by taking N number of 9\'s,and he will square that string and then he will sum up the digits of string. Now this new formed number will be the amount of candies that Santa will give to Chef.\nFor example:\nIf N is 2 then String will be "99"\nnow after squaring this string, the new string will become 99^2 = "9801",\nnow the amount of candies will be sum of digits i.e  9+8+0+1 = 18\nNow Santa will return 18 Candies. \nBut the problem is that Santa is not good in maths, so Santa told you to find this number. \nInput:\nTake the value of N\nOutput:\nNumber of candies\nConstraint:\n1 <= N <= 10^9\nSample Input 1\n2\nSample Output 1\n18\nSample Input 2\n109\nSample Output 2\n981\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85avishake_maji\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHRGIFTS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 avishake_maji, jc22020, medium, number-theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
