b'\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nThis is an interactive problem.\nJoshua is hiding a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN, where N is even. He wants to play a game with you. Your goal is to guess the sequence.\nFirst, Joshua tells you A1 and AN. Then, you should ask him queries. In each query, you choose four integers L1, R1, L2 and R2 such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4L1<R1\xe2\x89\xa4N and 1\xe2\x89\xa4L2<R2\xe2\x89\xa4N, and Joshua\'s answer is the maximum of AL1,AL1+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,AR1 minus the minimum of AL2,AL2+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,AR2.\nCan you find the sequence using no more than 2N queries?\nInteraction\n\nFirst, you should read a line containing three space-separated integers N, A1 and AN.\nThen you may ask queries. To ask a query:\nPrint a line containing the character \'Q\' followed by a space and four space-separated integers L1, R1, L2 and R2.\nThen, read a line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the answer to the query.\nWhen you think you know the sequence, print a single line containing the character \'!\' followed by a space and N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN describing your guess.\n\nDon\'t forget to flush the output after printing each line!\nConstraints\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nN is even\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n\nExample\nYou                         Grader\n                            4 1 1\nQ 1 2 3 4\n                            1\nQ 3 4 1 3\n                            2\n! 1 2 3 1\n\nExplanation\nJoshua has the sequence [1,2,3,1].\nFor the first query, the maximum of A1,A2 is 2 and the minimum of A3,A4 is 1, so the answer to this query is 2\xe2\x88\x921=1.\nFor the second query, the maximum of A3,A4 is 3 and the minimum of A1,A3 is 1, so the answer is 3\xe2\x88\x921=2.\nFinally, we correctly guess the sequence by printing "! 1 2 3 1".\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85ki0apa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MYSAR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Interactive Problems, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Special, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2977\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
