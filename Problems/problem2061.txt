You need to add M nodes to it in the given order. All the nodes have values. Cost for adding a node A with value va to another node B with value vb is va*vb. There is an additional cost of y (so total cost of va*vb+y) if B has atleast x child nodes. After node A has been added to another node B it becomes a child of B.\nAfter adding a node A to the tree, nodes next in list can be added to A also. You need to calculate the total minimal cost to add all M nodes in given order.\nInput\nThe first line of input contains N. The second line of input contains N integers representing the values of nodes in order from node 1 to node N. N-1 lines follow, each line defines an edge. Each line has 2 integers, which says that those 2 nodes are connected.\nNext line of input contains an integer Q, denoting the number of queries you need to answer. Each query consists of 2 lines. The first line of each query has 3 integers, M x y. The second line of each query has M integers representing the values of the nodes to be added in order.\nNote that in each query, M nodes are added to the initial tree, and hence changes made in previous query should not be considered in later queries\nOutput\nFor each query, output a single line containing the minimal total cost to add all the nodes in given order.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 x \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 y \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Values of all nodes in input \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n2 2 3\n1 2\n2 3\n2\n2 2 10\n10 10\n3 2 10\n1 2 2\n\nOutput:\n40\n6\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nQuery 1.\nOptimal solution is to add the first node from the query to node 1 of the tree and the second node from the query to node 2 of the tree. Cost is 10*2 + 10*2.\nQuery 2.\nOptimal solution is to add the first node from the query to node 1 of the tree for a cost 2. Then add next two nodes from the query to newly added node.\nTotal cost is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85anudeep2011\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85gerald\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ANUBTT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Min Cost Max flow\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos, Flow Networks, Maximum Flow\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3064\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-04-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n4 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
