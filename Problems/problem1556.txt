b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThere is a chessboard with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and N columns (numbered 1 through N). M squares on this chessboard (numbered 1 through M) are marked. For each valid i, the i-th of the marked squares is in the ri-th row and ci-th column.\nYou should perform the following process:\n\nFirst, you take a rook and put this rook on one of the marked squares.\nThen you move the rook M\xe2\x88\x921 times; since it is a rook, each of these moves must be to a marked square in the same row or the same column as the square where the rook was currently standing.\nThe rook must visit each of the marked squares exactly once. In each move, squares strictly between those where the rook stands immediately before and after this move are not visited by the rook.\nAlso, the directions of the moves must alternate \xe2\x80\x95 you may not move the rook in the same row twice or in the same column twice in any two consecutive moves.\n\nFind one valid path for the rook that visits the marked squares. It is guaranteed that at least one such path exists. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nM lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ri and ci.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing M space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x95 the indices of marked squares in the order in which the rook should visit them. These integers should form a permutation of 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,M.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa450,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ri,ci\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\nall marked squares are distinct\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): M\xe2\x89\xa415\nSubtask #2 (90 points): original constraints\nExample Input\n2\n2 4\n1 1\n1 2\n2 1\n2 2\n1 1\n1 1\n\nExample Output\n1 3 4 2\n1\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nildar_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ROOKPATH\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bipartite Graphs\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2892\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-11-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
