b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a rooted tree with N vertices (numbered 1 through N); vertex 1 is the root. Each vertex has a weight; let's denote the weight of vertex i by wi.\nYou should answer Q queries. The queries have to be processed online, i.e. to obtain each query, you need the answer to the previous query.\nIn each query, you are given a vertex v and a parameter k. For each vertex u in the subtree of v (including v), consider the value wu\xe2\x8a\x95k (\xe2\x8a\x95 denotes the bitwise XOR operation). The answer to this query is the maximum of these values and the smallest u such that vertex u is in the subtree of vertex v and wu\xe2\x8a\x95k is equal to this maximum.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers w1,w2,\xe2\x80\xa6,wN.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers x and y denoting that there is an edge between nodes x and y.\nThe next Q lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers a and b. The parameters v and k can be obtained in the following way: let's denote the value and vertex from the answer to the previous query by xl and vl respectively (xl=vl=0 if this is the first query); then, v=a\xe2\x8a\x95vl and k=b\xe2\x8a\x95xl.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing two space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x94 the answer to the query, i.e. the number of the vertex for which we get the maximum value and the maximum value.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4wi<220 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4k<220\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5,000\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 5,000\n\nSubtask #2 (15 points):\n\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2,000\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nSubtask #3 (75 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n10 5\n9 17 93 16 3 61 23 11 2 1\n1 2\n2 5\n5 8\n1 3\n1 4\n3 6\n3 7\n6 9\n6 10\n4 14\n7 123\n5 103\n9 32\n5 118\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4 30\n7 114\n8 30\n3 99\n6 40\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85evilbuggy\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/XORMIN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Persistent Tries, Segment Trees\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Persistent Structures, Advanced Tree Structures\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2585\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-03-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
