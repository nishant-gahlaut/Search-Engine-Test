b"\nRead problem statements in Mandarin, Bengali, and Russian as well.\nYou are given a positive integer NN. Consider a square grid of size N\xc3\x97N, with rows numbered  1 to N from top to bottom and columns numbered 1 to N from left to right. Initially you are at (1,1) and you have to reach (N,N). From a cell you can either move one cell to the right or one cell down (if possible). Formally, if you are at (i,j), then you can either move to (i+1,j) if i<N, or to (i,j+1) if j<N.\nThere are exactly N blocks in the grid, such that each row contains exactly one block and each column contains exactly one block. You can't move to a cell which contains a block. It is guaranteed that blocks will not placed in (1,1) and (N,N).\nYou have to find out whether you can reach (N,N).\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains N - the size of the square grid.\nThe i-th line of the next N lines contains two integers Xi and Yi indicating that (Xi,Yi) is the position of a block in the grid.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, if there exists a path from (1,1) to (N,N), output YES, otherwise output NO.\nYou may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be treated as identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Xi,Yi\xe2\x89\xa4N\n(Xi,Yi)\xe2\x89\xa0(1,1) and (Xi,Yi)\xe2\x89\xa0(N,N) for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\nXi\xe2\x89\xa0Xj and Yi\xe2\x89\xa0Yj for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4N\nSum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n2\n1 2\n2 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\n\nTest case 1: We can follow the path (1,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,2)\xe2\x86\x92(3,2)\xe2\x86\x92(3,3).\n\n\n\nTest case 2: We can't move from the starting point, so it is impossible to reach (N,N).\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85dazlersan1\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RECHEND\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 2D Arrays, Sorting, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2095\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-10-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
