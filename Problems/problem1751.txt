Chef wanted to prove them wrong, so he accepted a challenge from them to guess their ages.\nThe N people gave Chef M pieces of information to help him. Each piece of information is described by four integers t, u, v and c with the following meaning:\n\nIf t=1, the u-th person is older than the v-th person by at least c years.\nIf t=2, the u-th person is not older than the v-th person by at least c years.\n\nChef also knows that all the ages are integers (strangely, not necessarily positive integers) and that the age of person 1 is zero.\nBefore Chef started thinking about the ages, he asked you to tell him whether it is even possible to determine the ages of all N people uniquely using the information he has. Find out if it is possible and what the ages of these N people are in that case.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nEach of the following M lines contains four space-separated integers t, u, v and c describing one piece of information.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nIf it is impossible to uniquely determine the ages of all the people, print a single line containing the string "NO" (without quotes).\nOtherwise, print two lines.\nThe first of these lines should contain a single string "YES" (without quotes).\nThe second line should contain N space-separated integers denoting the ages of people 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N respectively.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa45,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa42\nu\xe2\x89\xa0v\n1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4109\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 10,000\nthe sum of M over all test cases does not exceed 50,000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 1\n1 1 2 5\n2 2\n1 2 1 6\n2 2 1 7\n2 2\n1 2 1 6\n2 2 1 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNO\nYES\n0 6\nNO\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GUESSAGE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bellman-Ford Algorithm\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Graph Algos, Shortest Paths\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2890\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-04-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
