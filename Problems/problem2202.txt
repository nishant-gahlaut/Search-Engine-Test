b'\nOur friend Shubham loved solving maths problems. Today he came accross this function which is used to calculate the strength of a number\n\n\tint strength(int N) {\n\t\tint value = 0, temp = N;\n\t\t/*Array lp stores the lowest prime divisor \n                  i.e. lp[x] stores lowest prime divisor of x*/\n\t\twhile(temp != 1) {\n\t\t\tvalue += N / lp[temp];\n\t\t\ttemp /= lp[temp];\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn value;\n\t}\n\n\nHaving learnt sieving and related algorithms, we was able to calculate the above function efficiently. But, his friend gave him a harder task to calculate. \n\nYou, being a good programmer, want to help Shubham with this difficult task. Since, this sum can be very large, you are required to output this value modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\nInput\nThe input consists of T test cases. For each test case you are given 2 numbers N, k, as specified in problem statement.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print the required answer for the summation function expressed above, modulo 1000000007.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 4\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1010\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 k \xe2\x89\xa4 1018\nSample Input\n2\n3 1\n6 2\n\nSample Output\n12\n1692\n\nExplanation\nHere F(x) denotes strength(x)\nIn first test case, the terms added are F(3) + F(6) + F(9) which evaluate to 1 + 5 + 6 = 12..\n\nIn the second test case, the terms added are F(36) + F(72) + F(108) + F(144) + F(180). The sum evalutes to 60 + 156 + 216 + 384 + 336 + 540 = 1692.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85likecs\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ICL1706\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 arithmetic-progression, derivative, hard, icl2017, likecs, likecs\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3125\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-03-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
