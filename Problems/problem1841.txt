b'\n\xc2\xa0\nOnce upon a time there was a kingdom called Ladoo Land. Ladooland had recently\nbeen at war with Gol Gappa Land. The Senapati of Ladooland played a major role and \nwon the war for his kingdom. \nThe king was extremely pleased with his Senapati. So he organised a great parade to \nhonour his Senapati Ladoo Veer. \nThe Senapati was rewarded handsomely with ladoos. He felt that he would not be able to \neat all the ladoos, so he decided to give away N ladoos amongst his M soldiers. \nThe Senapati asked his son Ladoo Singh to distribute the ladoos in a way that each soldier \ngets at least 2 ladoos. \nCan you help Ladoo Singh help find the number of ways to do so?.\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nFirst line contains single integer T, the number of test cases.
