The magician had NN boxes (numbered 11 through NN) and a gold coin. He challenged Chef to play a game with him; if Chef won the game, he could have the coin, but if he lost, the magician would kidnap Chef.\nAt the beginning of the game, the magician places the gold coin into the XX-th box. Then, he performs SS swaps. To win, Chef needs to correctly identify the position of the coin after all swaps.\nIn each swap, the magician chooses two boxes AA and BB, moves the contents of box AA (before the swap) to box BB and the contents of box BB (before the swap) to box AA.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, XX and SS.\nSS lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers AA and BB denoting a pair of swapped boxes.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of the box containing the gold coin after all swaps are performed.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X,A,B\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4X,A,B\xe2\x89\xa4N\nA\xe2\x89\xa0BA\xe2\x89\xa0B\nthe sum of SS for all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x88\x971052\xe2\x88\x97105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5 2 4\n4 2\n3 4\n3 2\n1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n\nafter the first swap, the coin is in box 44\nafter the second swap, the coin is in box 33\nafter the third swap, the coin is in box 22\nafter the fourth swap, the coin is in box 11\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85shivam_g1470\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MAGICHF\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Conditional Statements, Brute Force, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Basic Programming Concepts, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1088\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-08-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
