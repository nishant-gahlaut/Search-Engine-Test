b"\nThere are NN players standing in a line, indexed 11 to NN from left to right. They all play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Each player has already decided which move they want to play. You are given this information as a string SS of length NN, i.e,\n\nSiSi is equal to RR if player ii will play Rock.\nSiSi is equal to PP if player ii will play Paper.\nSiSi is equal to SS if player ii will play Scissors.\n\nLet W(i,j)W(i,j) denote the move played by the winner if players i,i+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ji,i+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,j compete in order from left to right. That is, \n\nFirst, players ii and i+1i+1 play a game\nThe winner of this game plays against player i+2i+2\nThe winner of the second game plays against player i+3i+3\n\n\xe2\x8b\xae\xe2\x8b\xae\n\nThe winner of the first j\xe2\x88\x92i\xe2\x88\x921j\xe2\x88\x92i\xe2\x88\x921 games plays against player jj, and the move played by the winner of this game is declared to be W(i,j)W(i,j).\n\nIf i=ji=j, then player ii is considered to be the winner and W(i,i)=SiW(i,i)=Si.\nYour task is to find the value of W(i,N)W(i,N) for all ii from 11 to NN.\nNote : \nIf a person with index ii and index jj (i<ji<j) play against each other, then:\n\nIf Si\xe2\x89\xa0SjSi\xe2\x89\xa0Sj, the winner is decided by classical rules, i.e, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.\nIf Si=SjSi=Sj, the player with lower index (in this case, ii) wins.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN, the number of players.\nThe second line of each test case contains the string SS of length NN, denoting the moves chosen by the players.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing a string of length NN, whose ii-th character is W(i,N)W(i,N).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\nSiSi is either RR, PP or SS\nSum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask 1 (10 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa450001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45000\nSum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 50005000\n\nSubtask 2 (90 points):\n\nOriginal constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\nS\n4\nSSPR\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nS\nRRPR\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1. W(1,1)=SW(1,1)=S as there is only one player.   \nTest Case 2.\nFor W(1,4)W(1,4) the game is played as follows  :\n\nPlayer 11 and 22 compete, player 11 wins.\nPlayer 11 and 33 compete, player 11 wins.\nPlayer 11 and 44 compete, player 44 wins.\n\nHence, we print W(1,4)=S4=RW(1,4)=S4=R\nFor W(3,4)W(3,4) the game is played as follows  :\n\nPlayer 33 and 44 compete, player 33 wins.\n\nHence, we print W(3,4)=S3=PW(3,4)=S3=P\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsuryaprak_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ROPASCI\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Maps, Hashmaps, Bottom-up, Sorting, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, DP Approach\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-12-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
