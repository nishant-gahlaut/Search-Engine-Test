b'\nThis problem is similar to the problem "STRFLIP2". The only difference between them is the number of moves allowed \xe2\x80\x94 in this problem, up to $N$ moves can be made. In Div. 1 and Div. 2 this problem is worth $40$ points and "STRFLIP2" is worth $60$. In Div. 3 this problem is worth $100$ points and "STRFLIP2" is non-scorable.\nYou are given a binary string $A$ of length $N$, which we treat as being $1$-indexed.\nIn one move, you are allowed to\n\nPick a contiguous substring (i.e. $A[L:R]$ for some $1 \\leq L \\leq R \\leq N$) of $A$ that contains at least one \'$0$\' and at least one \'$1$\'\nFlip all the characters of the chosen substring (i.e. change every $0$ to $1$ and every $1$ to $0$)\n\nYou are also given a target string $B$ of the same length as $A$.\nDetermine if it is possible to convert $A$ to $B$ by applying a sequence of moves as described above.\nIf it is possible to convert $A$ to $B$, then find a sequence of no more than $N$ moves that accomplishes this.\nIt can be shown that whenever it is possible to convert $A$ to $B$, then it is possible to do so using no more than $N$ moves.\nIf there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\nEach test case consists of three lines.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$, the size of the strings.\nThe second line of each test case contains $A$, a binary string with $N$ characters.\nThe third line of each test case contains $B$, a binary string with $N$ characters.\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each test case, print the answer starting from a new line in the following format:\nIn the first line, print $-1$ if it is impossible to convert $A$ to $B$. Otherwise, print a single non-negative integer $K$ \xe2\x80\x94 the number of moves that your solution requires.\nUse the next $K$ lines to describe your sequence of moves, in the same order they are to be performed.\nThe $i^{th}$ of these $K$ lines should contain two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$, denoting the starting and ending positions of the substring chosen in the $i^{th}$ operation.\nNote that the following conditions must be satisfied:\n$0 \\leq K \\leq N$\n$1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq N$ for each valid $i$\nEach substring $A[L_i : R_i]$ must contain at least one \'$0$\' and one \'$1$\'.\n\nConstraints\n\n$1 \\leq T \\leq 2000$\n$20 \\leq N \\leq 10^3$\nThe sum of $N$ over all testcases does not exceed $5000$\n$|A| = |B| = N$\n$A$ and $B$ are binary strings, i.e, contain only $0$ and $1$.\nAt most $N$ moves can be made for each testcase.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n5\n10110\n00100\n5\n00000\n11111\n1\n00\n00\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1 4\n2 3\n-1\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nNote: The sample tests use strings of small lengths just to illustrate the problem, and will not be present in the actual tests. Every string in the actual test files will have a length of at least $20$, as stated by the constraints.\nTest Case $1$: The given string is $A = 10110$. Apart from the single character substrings and the substring $A[3:4] = 11$, all other substrings are valid first moves.\nThe sample output performs moves as follows:\n\nFirst, flip the substring $A[1:4]$. Now, $A = 01000$.\nThen, flip the substring $A[2:3]$. Now, $A = 00100$, which is the target string.\n\nNote that there are several other valid solutions, and any solution using no more than $5$ moves will be accepted. For example, a sequence of $3$ moves is shown below:\n\nFlip $A[1:5]$, giving $A = 01001$\nFlip $A[4:5]$, giving $A = 01010$\nFlip $A[2:4]$, giving $A = 00100$\n\nTest Case 2: The given string $A = 00000$ has no substring with both $0$ and $1$, consequently there are no moves possible. Therefore it is impossible to convert this string to $B = 11111$.\nTest Case 3: The given string $A = 00$ is already equal to $B$ and so no moves are required.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nutkarsh_adm\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85aryanc403\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/STRFLIP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 constructive, easy-medium, medium, start22, utkarsh_adm\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3635\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-01-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
