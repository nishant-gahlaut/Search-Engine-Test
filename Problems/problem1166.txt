b"\nRuman loves creating software. He has recently created a new open source project which is gaining popularity exponentially. Many skilled developers all across the globe want to contribute to his project. Pull resuests are just flowing in every day. There are a lot of options for Ruman, but he doesn't have time to address each one of them. His project has received pull requests in the past NN days consecutively, and the sequence A1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN describes the number of requests received each day. Now, he wants to check as many requests as possible but not exceeding KK, because there's a limit to everything. And, he wants to pick requests only from a contiguous subsequence of days. If there are multiple such contiguous subsequences for which the pull requests are maximum possible (not exceeding KK), then he'll prefer the range of days which starts the earliest.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space separated integers NN and KK.\nThe second line contains NN space separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case print a single line containing three space separated integers LL, RR and \xe2\x88\x91i=LRAi\xe2\x88\x91i=LRAi.\nIf it is not possible to find such a contiguous segment, print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 in a single line.\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109, for each valid ii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa410141\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41014\nSum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 106106\n\nSubtasks:\n\n10 points:\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa410111\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41011\nSum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 100100\n30 points:\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa410121\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41012\nSum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 103103\n60 points: original constraints\n\nSample Input:\n3\n3 2\n1 1 1\n3 12\n1 7 2\n3 5\n6 6 6\n\nSample Output:\n1 2 2\n1 3 10\n-1\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85ankushkhanna\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DWW19D\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ankushkhanna, ankushkhanna, binary-search, dwwu2019, easy, prefix-sum, sliding-window, two-pointers\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-12-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
