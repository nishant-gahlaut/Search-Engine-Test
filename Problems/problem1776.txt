b"\nTwo chefs are working in a kitchen with two ovens.\nEach chef has a list of dishes to prepare.\nEach chef must complete the dishes on his list, and in the order in which they appear on his list.\nThe chefs have already prepared the items, and need only cook them.\nEach oven can only cook one dish at a time, and once a dish enters an oven it must remain in the oven for the full cooking time.\nA dish is considered completed when it is done cooking.\nThat is, dishes need not enter the ovens in order, but must finish cooking in order\n(it is okay for 2 dishes from the same chef to finish cooking simultaneously).\nThe chefs cannot clean up and go home until both of them have completed all their dishes,\nand they want to go home as soon as possible.\nYour task is to determine the minimal amount of time it will take the chefs to complete all dishes.\nInput:\nInput consists of 3 lines.\nThe first line contains 2 integers N1 and N2, the number of dishes to be completed by the\nfirst and second chefs, respectively.\nThe second line contains N1 integers giving the cooking times of the first chef's dishes,\nin the order in which they must be completed.\nThe third line contains N2 integers giving the cooking times of the second chef's dishes,\nin the order in which they must be completed.\n\nOutput:\nOutput on a single line the minimum amount of time (in minutes) for both \nchefs to complete all dishes.\nExample\nInput 1:\n4 4\n20 20 25 25\n40 10 10 40\n \nOuput 1:\n100\n \nOne way to finish in 100 minutes is for the one chef to cook all his dishes in one oven, and the other chef to cook all his dishes in the other oven.  Note that although the dishes could be cooked in only 95 minutes, they cannot be completed in the correct order in only 95 minutes.\n\nInput 2:\n3 1\n15 16 21\n10\n \nOutput 2:\n31\n \nOne oven will cook the 10 minute and 21 minute dishes, the other the 15 and 16 minute dishes.\nThe first chef's third dish enters an oven before his second dish, but the dishes finish cooking at the same time\nand therefore are still considered to have completed in the correct order.\nConstraints:\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N1 \xe2\x89\xa4 50\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N2 \xe2\x89\xa4 50\nAll cooking times are between 1 and 60 minutes, inclusive.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndavid_adm\n\n\nTester:\nMaksflow\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TWOCHEFS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DP Approach, Memoization\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Recursion\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-09-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.193807 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
