b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\n\nGiven a sequence of n numbers A[1..n], a length-k increasing subsequence (IS) is A[i1], A[i2], ..., A[ik] such that both the indices i and values are strictly increasing. Among all possible IS's, denote the maximum length as L. Now we are interested in finding how many length-(L-1) IS's are there.\n\n\nTwo IS's are different if and only if their indices are different.\n\n\nSince the answer could be very large, you are just required to output its remainder with 10^9 + 7.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains an integer T denoting the total number of test cases.\nFor each test case, the first line contains a single integer n, and the second line contains the space-separated sequence A[1..n].\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the answer per line.\nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <= 10\n1 <= n <= 10^5\n1 <= A[i] <= 10^9\n1 < L\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n1 1 2\n5\n6 8 1 2 3\n5\n2 3 1 6 8\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n4\n5\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. L = 2.
