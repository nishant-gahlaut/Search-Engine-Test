b'\nChef has had a recipe. He had written it as a sequence of N integer numbers A[1], A[2], ..., A[N]. To be on the safe side, he decided to write out M triples of numbers, where i-th triple is composed of three numbers Xi, Yi and Zi. It means that the sum of numbers in the recipe from Xi-th to Yi-th is equal to Zi. In other words, A[Xi] +  A[Xi + 1] + ... + A[Yi] = Zi. Unfortunately, the recipe has been recently lost. So Chef needs to restore his recipe using these M triples. Your task is to help him.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains two space separated integer numbers N and M.\nThen M lines follow. Each line contains three space separated integer numbers Xi, Yi and Zi. It means that the sum of numbers in the recipe from Xi-th to Yi-th is equal to Zi.\n\nOutput\nIf there is a solution output N space separated integer numbers - the sequence that you have restored. If there are several solutions you can output any of them. However, any number in the output should be no more than 1014 by its absolute value. If it is impossible to restore the sequence output "-1" without quotes.\n\nConstraints\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 65536\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 200000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Xi \xe2\x89\xa4 Yi \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n|Zi| \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000000 (109)\nIf It is possible to restore the sequence then there is way to do this such that every number in the restored sequence is in range [-10000; 10000]\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4 4\n1 2 3\n2 3 1\n3 4 -2\n1 4 1  \n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 2 -1 -1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5 3\n1 3 4\n4 5 6\n1 5 9 \n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\n                    In the first test case the answer is not unique. Possible answers are also {0, 3, -2, 0}, {2, 1, 0, -2} and many others.\n\nIn the second test case first two conditions imply A[1] + A[2] + A[3] = 4 and A[4] + A[5] = 6 and hence A[1] + A[2] + A[3] + A[4] + A[5] = (A[1] + A[2] + A[3]) + (A[4] + A[5]) = 4 + 6 = 10. And it contradicts to the third condition. Hence it is impossible to restore the recipe.\n\n                \n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\nAuthor:\nsergey_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85anton_lunyov\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RSRECIPE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DFS, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2196\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-11-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.298851 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
