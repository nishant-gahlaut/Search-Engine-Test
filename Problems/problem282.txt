b'\nRead problem statements in Russian, Bengali, and Mandarin Chinese as well.\nThere are NN students standing in a canteen queue, numbered 11 to NN from left to right. For each valid ii, the ii-th student has a height hihi.\nTwo students ii and jj can see each other if there are no taller students standing between them. Formally, students ii and jj (i<ji<j) can see each other if for each integer kk (i<k<ji<k<j), hk\xe2\x89\xa4hi,hjhk\xe2\x89\xa4hi,hj.\nFor each valid ii, determine the number cici of students that have the same height as student ii and can be seen by student ii.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers h1,h2,\xe2\x80\xa6,hNh1,h2,\xe2\x80\xa6,hN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers c1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cNc1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cN.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 105105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 103103\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n1 2 2 3 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0 1 1 0 0\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Student 33 can see students 22 and 44, but only student 22 has the same height (height 22). On the other hand, student 33 cannot see student 55 since student 44 is taller and therefore blocking the view.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nnbmnb\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LUNCHTIM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Stacks, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1773\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-01-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
