b'\nChef & Chefu used to walk every day in the evening . But for the pandemic situation they  walk once in a week.\nFor some fun they decide,they will walk according to two strings S1S1 and S2S2. Both string contain combination of all lower case alphabet ( a to z) and last character of both string must contain (\'e\' or \'n\' or \'s\' or \'w\'). The last character of each string indicates direction , easy to say  e ->east , n ->north,s ->south and  w ->west. And all characters of each string indicate ( with out last  character ) how much distance they will cover.\nBut they are busy now and need your help to calculate how much distance they will cover at which direction.\nIf string S1:  \'abbcabbce\'  & string S2:  \'baacban\', then answer is  " 4 east 3 north ". (For 1st string S1 contains 4 times \'b\' whose occurrence is maximum  in S1 and last character of S1 is \'e\' . So \'e\' -> east. For 2nd string S2  contains 3 times \'a\' and last character is \'n\' -> north. )  \nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains two lines of string input, 1st line contains string S1S1 and 2nd line contains string S2S2. \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line answer  how much distance they will cover at which direction for each string. And distance & direction must be space separated.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4|S1|,|S2|\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4|S1|,|S2|\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSample Input:\n1\nabcabbaae\nfrcetrceron\nSample Output:\n4 east 3 north\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85sourav472\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/NBC002\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, hashing, map, noob2020, sourav472\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-11-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
