b'\nThe chef was a former student of thermodynamics in his college. Once he decided to conduct a small experiment in his kitchen.\nSuppose there are n identical isolated containers ranging temperature from -100 to 100 including absolute zero. Chef wants to know the product of the maximum Product subarray of containers.\nInput :\n\nThe First line of input contains the number of test cases t.\nThe First line of each test case contains the number of containers n.\nThe second line consists of n spaced integers corresponding to the temperature of the containers.\n\nOutput:\n\nThe output should consist of a single integer corresponding to the product of the maximum product subarray\n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= N <= 500\n-100 <= Arr[i] <= 100\n\nSample Input:\n7\n\n-6   4  -5  8  -10  0  8\nSample Output:\n1600\n\nExplanation:\nSubarray with maximum product\nis  4, -5, 8, -10 which gives the product as 1600.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85furious_127\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MAXPROD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 array, furious_127, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-01-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
