Someone shuffled the eggs!\nCiel knows the values Ai, however she doesn't know which egg is which.\nShe'd like to minimize the worst-case number of taps.\nWhat is the minimal number?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.\nThen T test cases follow.\nThe first line for each test case has 2 integers N and K.\nThen next line has N integers A1, A2, ..., AN.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print the minimal number of taps for the worst-case.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 500\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000 (106)\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 1\n5 8\n2 1\n5 58\n3 2\n1 2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8\n10\n5\n\n\nExplanation\n\nIn the first case, if a egg isn't broken after 5 taps, she should continue to tap the same egg.\n\n\nIn the second case, if a egg isn't broken after 5 taps, she should tap another egg 5 times.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nhiroto_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85pieguy\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/STREGGS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2024\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-08-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.04894 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
