b'\n\nEvery great chef knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representations contain only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.   \n\nOur chef has recently returned from the Lucky country. He observed that every restaurant in the Lucky country had a lucky number as its name. \nHe believes that having a lucky number as a restaurant name can indeed turn out to be very lucky.   \n\nOur chef believes that it is possible to make a lucky number having N digits even luckier. Any number following the rules below is called Lucky lucky number -   \n \n 1. The number contains only digits 4 and 7. \n 2. Count of digit 4 in the number should be divisible by 7. \n 3. Count of digit 7 in the number should be divisible by 4.  \n\nHelp our chef to compute the count of digit 4 in the smallest Lucky lucky number having N digits. \n\nInput\n\nFirst line contains T, number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a number N, the number of digits in the Lucky lucky number to be formed.  \n\n1<=T<=1000 \n1<=N<=1000000000 (10^9) \n\nOutput\n\nIf it is not possible to form a Lucky lucky number having N digits, output -1.\nOtherwise, output the count of digit 4 in the smallest Lucky lucky number having N digits.\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n7\n4\n11\n1\n15\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n7\n0\n7\n-1\n7\n\n\nExplanation\nFor the last test case, N = 15, the smallest lucky lucky number is\n\nThe count of digit 4 is 7.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nisha_adm\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85subra\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFLUCK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, isha_adm, may12\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1302\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-03-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.607143 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
