For each valid i, the i-th chocolate has a sweetness value Wi. Chef is going to play the following randomised game for fun with his brother:\n\nFirst, an integer k between 1 and N (inclusive) is chosen uniformly randomly.\nThen, k times, Chef chooses a chocolate from the box uniformly randomly and independently (each chocolate may be chosen multiple times). For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4k), let's denote the sweetness of the i-th chocolate chosen by Chef by Ai.\nChef's brother does the same thing \xe2\x80\x95 k times, he also chooses a chocolate from the box uniformly randomly and independently from each other or Chef's choices (so each chocolate may still be chosen multiple times). For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4k), let's denote the sweetness of the i-th chocolate chosen by Chef's brother by Bi.\nThe score of the game is \xe2\x88\x91ki=1\xe2\x88\x91kj=1gcd(Ai,Bj).\n\nFind the expected value of the score. It can be proved that this expected value can be expressed as a fraction PQ, where P and Q are positive integers and Q is coprime with 998,244,353. You should compute P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 998,244,353, where Q\xe2\x88\x921 denotes the multiplicative inverse of Q modulo 998,244,353.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers W1,W2,\xe2\x80\xa6,WN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 998,244,353.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Wi\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105 for each valid i\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n2 2 2 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n887328320\n15\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 2:\n\nWhen k=1, the score is 12\xe2\x8b\x852=2.\nWhen k=2, the score is 22\xe2\x8b\x852=8.\nWhen k=3, the score is 32\xe2\x8b\x852=18.\nWhen k=4, the score is 42\xe2\x8b\x852=32.\n\nThe expected score is 2+8+18+324=15.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85imanik\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RANDCHCL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Combinatorics, Expected Value\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Probability\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2450\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-03-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
