b'\n\nChef likes to travel very much. He plans some travel routes and wants to know their lengths. He hired you to make these calculations. But be careful, some of the routes are incorrect. There may be some misspelling in city names or there will be no road between some two consecutive cities in the route. Also note that Chef hates to visit the same city twice during his travel. Even the last city should differ from the first. Two consecutive cities in the route should also be different. So you need to check these conditions for the given routes too.\n\nYou will be given the list of all cities and all roads between them with their lengths. All roads are one-way. Also you will be given the list of all travel routes that Chef plans. For each route you should check whether it is correct and find its length in this case.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains positive integer N, the number of cities. The second line contains space separated list of N strings, city names. All city names are distinct.\n\nThe third line contains non-negative integer M, the number of available roads. Each of the next M lines describes one road and contains names C1 and C2 of two cities followed by the positive integer D, the length of the one-way road that connects C1 with C2. It is guaranteed that C1 and C2 will be correct names of two different cities from the list of N cities given in the second line of the input file. For each pair of different cities there is at most one road in each direction and each road will be described exactly once in the input file.\n\nNext line contains positive integer T, the number of travel routes planned by the Chef. Each of the next T lines contains positive integer K followed by K strings, names of cities of the current route. Cities are given in order in which Chef will visit them during his travel.\n\nAll strings in the input file composed only of lowercase, uppercase letters of the English alphabet and hyphens. Each string is non-empty and has length at most 20. If some line of the input file contains more then one element than consecutive elements of this line are separated by exactly one space. Each line of the input file has no leading or trailing spaces.\n\nOutput\n For each travel route from the input file output a single line containing word ERROR if the route is incorrect and its length otherwise.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 <= N <= 50\n\n0 <= M <= N * (N - 1)\n\n1 <= D <= 20000\n\n1 <= T <= 50\n\n1 <= K <= 50\n\n1 <= length of each string <= 20\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\nDonetsk Kiev New-York Miami Hollywood\n9\nDonetsk Kiev 560\nKiev New-York 7507\nNew-York Miami 1764\nMiami Hollywood 28\nHollywood Miami 30\nMiami New-York 1764\nKiev Donetsk 550\nHollywood New-York 1736\nNew-York Hollywood 1738\n13\n5 Donetsk Kiev New-York Miami Hollywood\n5 Hollywood Miami New-York Kiev Donetsk\n3 Donetsk Kiev Donetsk\n2 Kyiv New-York\n3 New-York Hollywood Miami\n2 New-York Miami\n3 Hollywood New-York Miami\n4 Donetsk Kiev Miami Hollywood\n2 Donetsk Hollywood\n1 Donetsk\n2 Mumbai Deli\n6 Donetsk Kiev New-York Miami Hollywood New-York\n2 Miami Miami\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n9859\nERROR\nERROR\nERROR\n1768\n1764\n3500\nERROR\nERROR\n0\nERROR\nERROR\nERROR\n\n\nExplanation\n                    The 2nd route is incorrect since there is no road from New-York to Kiev. Note however that inverse road from Kiev to New-York exists. \nThe 3rd route is incorrect since the first city coincides with the last one. \nThe 4th route is incorrect since there is no city with name Kyiv (Probably Chef means Kiev but he misspells this word). \nThe 8th route is incorrect since there is no road from Miami to Kiev. \nThe 9th route is incorrect since there is no road from Donetsk to  Hollywood. \nThe 10th route is correct. Note that a route composed of exactly one city is always correct provided that city name is written correctly. \nThe 11th route is incorrect since there is no cities with names Mumbai and Deli. (Probably Chef is not so good in geography :)) \nThe 12th route is incorrect since city New-York is visited twice. \nFinally the 13th route is incorrect since we have equal consecutive cities.\n                \n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85anton_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85pieguy\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TRAVELER\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, Sets, Maps, Sorting, Brute Force, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1478\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-10-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.371951 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
