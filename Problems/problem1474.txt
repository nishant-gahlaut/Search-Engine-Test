b'\n\nA digit in a number N is a minima if it is lesser than both the digits adjacent to it. Similarly, a digit is a maxima if it is greater than both the digits adjacent to it. The slope of N is the number of digits in N (leaving out the first and the last digit) which are either a minima or a maxima. Given A and B, count the sum of the slopes of all numbers between A and B.\n\n\nInput :\n\n\nThe first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains two integers A and B.\n\n\nOutput :\n\n\nOutput T lines one for each test case, containing the required sum for the corresponding test case.\n\nConstraints :\n1 <= T <= 50000\n1 <= A <= B <= 1000000000000000 (10^15)\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n101 101\n1 100\n100 150\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n19\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsyco_adm\n\n\nTester:\n4\xe2\x98\x85keshav_57\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SUMSLOPE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Digit DP\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1899\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-04-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.102564 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n10000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
