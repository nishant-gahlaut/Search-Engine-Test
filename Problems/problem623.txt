b'\nYou are given an integer N and a (0-indexed) binary string A having length N+1. \nFind any permutation P of 0,1,2,...,N\xe2\x88\x921 (or determine that it does not exist) that satisfies the following conditions for all i (0\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N): \n\nif Ai=0: No contiguous segment of P has mex equal to i \nif Ai=1: There exists at least one contiguous segment of P that has mex equal to i\n\nIf multiple permutations exist that satisfy the given conditions, print any.\nNote: mex of a segment is the smallest non-negative number that does not occur in that segment.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains the number of test cases T. Description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line of each test case contains the binary string A of length N+1.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case print :\n\nYes if there exists a permutation P that satisfies the conditions described in the statement, followed by the permutation P in the next line (If multiple permutations exist that satisfy the given conditions, print any).\nNo otherwise.\n\nYou may print each character of Yes and No in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, YES will be considered identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105\n|A|=N+1\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n2\n111\n5\n110100\n5\n110101\n7\n11100111\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYes\n0 1\nNo\nYes\n0 2 1 4 3\nYes\n0 1 3 4 2 5 6\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case-1: One of the possible permutations satisfying the given conditions is [0,1] because:\n\nmex([1])=0. Therefore the condition is satisfied for i=0.\nmex([0])=1. Therefore the condition is satisfied for i=1.\nmex([0,1])=2. Therefore the condition is satisfied for i=2.\n\nTest case-2: It can be proven that no permutation exists that satisfies the given conditions.\nTest case-3: One of the possible permutations satisfying the given conditions is [0,2,1,4,3] because:\n\nmex([2])=0. Therefore the condition is satisfied for i=0.\nmex([0,2])=1. Therefore the condition is satisfied for i=1.\nThere does not exist any segment with mex=2. Therefore the condition is satisfied for i=2.\nmex([0,2,1])=3. Therefore the condition is satisfied for i=3.\nThere does not exist any segment with mex=4. Therefore the condition is satisfied for i=4.\nmex([0,2,1,4,3])=5. Therefore the condition is satisfied for i=5.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85boredm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PERMEX\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 boredm, constructive, cook138, easy, mex\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1874\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-02-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
