b'\nBanner: "Hulk? Hulk?? I know you are like making your entrance at the last second. But this is it, man. This is the last\xe2\x80\xa6last second.  Hulk! Hulk !! Hulk !!!"\nHulk: "NOOOOO!!!"\nBanner: "Ohhh screw you! You Big Green Asshole! I will do it myself" \nBanner finally figured out the issue with Hulk, and now they are known as Professor Hulk, who has elements present of both Banner as well as Hulk.     \nThe army of Thanos has arrived to prevent the Avengers from changing reality.\nThe army is divided into 3 different sections (A, B and C).\nProfessor Hulk has to follow certain conditions for smashing this army. At a given moment:-     \n(i) There has to be at least one member from each section to be smashed.\n(ii) The number of members to be smashed from section A has to be more than number of members to be smashed from section B.   \nOther Avengers are very busy with facing Thanos and thus they have given you the task to help Professor Hulk to find out the number of ways of smashing at a given moment given the number of members in each section of the army.  \nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThen TT lines follow, each line has three integers A, B and C, the number of members in each of the three sections respectively.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case output the number of ways of smashing at a moment following the given conditions. Output your answer modulo 10000000071000000007.\nConstraint:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa451\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4A\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4B\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4B\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4C\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4C\xe2\x89\xa41000\n\nSample Input:\n2\n3 2 1\n14 12 13\n\nSample Output:\n9\n305814440\n\nSample Explanation:\nIn the first test case, the number of members in A are 3 (a, b, c),\nB are 2 (d, e) and C is 1 (f). The different possible ways of smashing \n\nat a particular moment are {a, b, d, f}, {a, b, e, f}, {a, c, d, f}, {a, c, e, f},\n    {b, c, d, f}, {b, c, e, f}, {a, b, c, d, f}, {a, b, c, e, f} and\n    {a, b, c, d, e, f}, i.e. there are total 9 ways.   \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85shauryakr\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CR193\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cord2019, easy, maths, permutation, shauryakr\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-02-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
