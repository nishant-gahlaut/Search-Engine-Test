b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian \nYou have a permutation P of integers 1, 2, ... , N. You want to change it a little. To do this, you choose an integer K that satisfies an inequality 2 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 N. After that, you perform several (possibly, zero, if you're feeling lazy) cyclic shifts. For each cyclic shift you choose a K-length segment of the permutation P (let's denote it as Px, Px + 1, ..., Px + K - 2, Px + K - 1) and perform a cyclic shift on it towards the right. That is, rearrange elements of this segment in the order Px + K - 1, Px, ... , Px + K - 3, Px + K - 2.\nFor example, let's make a permutation (6, 5, 1, 3, 2, 4) from permutation (1, 5, 4, 6, 3, 2), using K = 4. Segments that are cyclically shifted on every move are underlined: (1, 5, 4, 6, 3, 2) => (6, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2)=> (6, 1, 2, 5, 4, 3) => (6, 1, 3, 2, 5, 4) => (6, 5, 1, 3, 2, 4).\nLet S denote the set of permutations that can be obtained from permutation P using zero or more cyclic shifts. You are given a permutation Q of integers 1, 2, ..., N. Your task is to find whether S contains Q or not. If so, also you must find the index of Q in the list of all permutations in set S, ordered lexicographically.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The  description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers N and K denoting the length of the permutations P and Q, and length of the segments that you are allowed to cyclically shift.\nNext line contains N integers P1, P2, ..., PN denoting the permutation P.\nNext line contains N integers Q1, Q2, ..., QN denoting the permutation Q.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line. It must contain -1, if permutation Q can't be obtained from permutation P using allowed cyclic shifts. Otherwise, print its 1-based index in the list of all permutations from set S, ordered lexicographically. Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo 109 + 7.\nConstraints\n\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 N\nP1, P2, ..., PN are forming a permutation of integers from 1 to N\nQ1, Q2, ..., QN are forming a permutation of integers from 1 to N\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask 1: (10 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n\n \nSubtask 2: (10 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\nK = N\n\n \nSubtask 3: (40 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n\n \nSubtask 4: (40 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\nOriginal constraints\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n4 2\n2 4 3 1\n1 2 4 3\n3 3\n1 2 3\n1 3 2\n\nOutput:\n2\n-1\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. Cyclic shift of segment of length 2 is swapping consecutive elements of the permutation. Using them, we are able to get any possible permutation. Permutation Q has index 2 in the list of all permutations of length 4.\nExample case 2. We are able to get permutations (1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 1) and (3, 1, 2). Permutation Q doesn't belong to this list, so answer is -1.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85eartemov\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PERSHFTS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, Modulo Multiplicative Inverse, Permutations & Combinations\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Mathematics, Modular Arithmetic, Combinatorics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2436\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-08-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
