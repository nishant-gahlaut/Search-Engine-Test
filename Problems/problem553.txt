b'\n Chef loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.\n\n Chef has a positive integer N. He can apply any of the following operations as many times as he want in any order:\n\n Add 1 to the number N.\n Take some digit of N and replace it by any non-zero digit.\n Add any non-zero leading digit to N.\n Find the minimum number of operations that is needed for changing N to the lucky number.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains a single positive integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a positive integer N without leading zeros. \n\nOutput\nFor each T test cases print one integer, the minimum number of operations that is needed for changing N to the lucky number.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N < 10100000\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n25\n46\n99\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85witaliy_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85anton_lunyov\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LUCKY5\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1478\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-12-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.75 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
