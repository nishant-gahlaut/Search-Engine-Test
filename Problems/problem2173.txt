b"\nRead problem statement in Mandarin chinese and Vietnamese.\nChefsberg consists of NN islands numbered 11 through NN connected by MM bridges numbered 11 through MM (in the order in which they are given in the input). Chefsberg was designed by the best coders of the world, and they decided to create the bridges in a way that makes Chefsberg extremely connected. In particular, it is always necessary to remove more than 33 bridges to disconnect Chefsberg.\nIn his free time, Suzumo keeps trying to find a way to visit all islands without crossing the same bridge twice (crossing it once in each direction is also forbidden).\nHelp Suzumo find a valid route. Remember that we are not in K\xc3\xb6nigsberg, but in Chefsberg, so we don't want to cross each bridge, but visit each island. Also, we are not helping Hamilton, but Suzumo, so it is allowed to visit the same island multiple times.\nIt is guaranteed that under the given constraints, at least one valid route exists.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows. \nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM denoting the number of islands and the number of bridges.\nEach of the following MM lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv representing a bidirectional bridge between islands uu and vv.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line. This line should start with an integer ss denoting the number of bridges in your chosen route, followed by ss space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x94 the indices of the bridges in the order in which they should be crossed.\nFor any given sequence of bridges, there are two possible choices of the starting island. Your answer will be considered correct if at least one of them produces a valid route.\nConstraints\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4642\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa464\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4642\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa464\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4(642)1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4(642)\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthere can be multiple bridges between the same pair of islands\nthere is no bridge connecting an island to itself\n\nExample Input\n1\n8 16\n1 2\n1 5\n1 4\n1 4\n2 3\n2 3\n2 6\n3 7\n3 4\n4 8\n5 6\n5 6\n5 8\n6 7\n7 8\n7 8\n\nExample Output\n9 2 11 12 13 15 16 10 9 5\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n\nThe structure of Chefsberg is described in the picture above.
