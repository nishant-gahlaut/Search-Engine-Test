b'\nChef\xe2\x80\x99s interest has been shifted towards cryptocurrency these days. As he is very rich and wants to educate more chefs about crypto, he has decided to distribute some of his bitcoins to NN junior chefs. He assigned the task of distributing his bitcoins to you. After distributing those bitcoins, you reported chef with data of distribution, an array AA with nn elements [a0a0, a1a1, a2a2\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6an\xe2\x88\x921an\xe2\x88\x921] where aiai denotes the number of bitcoin ithith junior chef received.  \nChef is a man of principals and after seeing the distribution he was really disappointed because the distribution looked very odd to him.  \nTo correct your mistake, you asked for the last chance to chef. This time chef gave you a clear instruction that distribute those bitcoins uniformly in such a way that ithith chef will always have either equal or more bitcoins than i\xe2\x88\x921thi\xe2\x88\x921th chef.  \nAs you\xe2\x80\x99ve already distributed the bitcoins, so now you\xe2\x80\x99re left with only limited options for re-distribution:  \nYou can either take all of the bitcoins from i\xe2\x88\x921thi\xe2\x88\x921th or i+1thi+1th (chosen) junior chef and give it to ithith junior chef which will make ithith junior chef\xe2\x80\x99s coins as aiai+ai\xe2\x88\x921ai\xe2\x88\x921 or aiai+ai+1ai+1 depending upon how you choose to distribute and the chosen junior chef will be removed from the array.  \nWhenever you take bitcoins from any junior chef, you make him/her sad but according to Chef\xe2\x80\x98s order, you need to make the distribution more uniform.  \nYou are a compassionate person hence you don\xe2\x80\x99t like to make people sad. Find a way of making the least number of junior chefs sad. Find how many junior chefs will get sad in order to make the distribution more uniform.  \nInput Format\n\nFirst-line will contain TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains the length of the initial distribution NN.\nThe second line of each test case contains n space-separated integers denoting n elements of the array AA.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line, an integer denoting the number of junior chefs you made sad.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41032\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4103\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nDistribution is already uniform, i.e none of the ithith chef has less bitcoins than i\xe2\x88\x921thi\xe2\x88\x921th chef.\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n7\n8 2 2 9 11 12 13\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the first step, give coins of 1st1st junior chef to 0th0th junior chef.
