b"\nRead problems statements Hindi , Vietnamese , Mandarin Chinese , Russian and Bengali as well.\nThis is an interactive problem.\nChef has cooked NN meatballs, numbered 11 through NN. No two meatballs contain the same amount of meat. You want to eat the meatiest meatball, i.e. the meatball with the maximum amount of meat, but you do not know which one it is and Chef does not want to just give it for you. Therefore, he decided to play a game with you.\nYou may ask Chef at most Q=4+N/2Q=4+N/2 questions. In each question, you must give Chef the numbers of five distinct meatballs and Chef tells you the numbers of the 33-rd and 44-th meatiest of these meatballs. Find the number of the meatiest meatball!\nInteraction\n\nFirst, you should read a line containing a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases.\nFor each test case, you should start by reading a line containing a single integer NN.\nTo ask a question, you should print a line containing the character '?', a space and five space-separated integers i1i1, i2i2, i3i3, i4i4 and i5i5: the numbers of five distinct meatballs (in any order). Then, you must read a line containing two space-separated integers: the numbers of the 33-rd and 44-th meatiest meatball.\nTo finish solving a test case, print a line containing the character '!', a space and an integer imim: the number of the meatiest meatball (1\xe2\x89\xa4im\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4im\xe2\x89\xa4N).\n\nDon't forget to flush the output after printing each line!\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n6\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41006\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (60 points): Q=N+3Q=N+3\nSubtask #2 (40 points): Q=4+N/2Q=4+N/2 (original constraints)\nExample\nYou               Grader\n                  1\n                  6\n? 1 2 3 4 5\n                  3 4\n? 1 2 3 4 6\n                  3 4\n? 1 2 3 5 6\n                  3 5\n? 1 2 4 5 6\n                  4 5\n? 1 3 4 5 6\n                  4 5\n? 2 3 4 5 6\n                  4 5\n! 6\n\nExplanation\nThe meatballs are sorted in ascending order of meatiness.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85wreckingball\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COMAS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dec18, easy, wreckingball\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2074\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-11-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
