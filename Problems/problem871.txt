b'\nThis is a peculiar functioning setup.\nTwo Tanks are separated from each other by a wall .There is a pipe in the wall which connects  both tanks  which allows flow of water between them . Due to this ,there is change in temperature of both tanks , every minute temperature of Tank with larger temperature among two decreases by one and temperature of Tank  with smaller temperature among two increases by two until equilibrium is reached , But there is a problem .\nThe pipe can\'t control this flow of water if there is Non-equilibrium (inequality of temperature  on  both sides )  even after mm minutes and the pipe will burst after it , your task is to predict whether the pipe will burst or not .\nNote: If equilibrium cannot be reached the process will continue forever.\nThe initial temperature of Cold Tank is TcTc , of Hot Tank it is ThTh. \nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, three  integers m,Tc,Thm,Tc,Th. \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line answer "Yes" if Pipe will burst after m minutes "No" if pipe will not burst.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4m,Tc,Th\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4m,Tc,Th\xe2\x89\xa4109\nTc\xe2\x89\xa4ThTc\xe2\x89\xa4Th\n\nSample Input:\n  2\n  4 5 10\n  2 2 5\n\nSample Output:\n   Yes\n   No\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85yashu2040\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/HOTNCOLD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 coca2020, easy, yashu2040\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-06-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
