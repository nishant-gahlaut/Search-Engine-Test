b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a tree with N nodes numbered 1 through N.\nA subset S of nodes of the tree is called connected if, for any two nodes from S, the simple path between these two nodes in the tree contains only nodes which belong to S.\nChef defines the cost of a connected subset S as |S| \xc2\xb7 AND(S). Here, |S| denotes the size of the set S and  AND(S) denotes the bitwise AND of indices of all nodes from S.\nChef would like to know the maximum of costs of all connected subsets. Can you help him?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nEach of the following N-1 lines contains two space-separated integers x and y denoting an edge between nodes x and y of the tree.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum cost of a connected subset.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 30\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100,000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 x, y \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of N over all test cases  \xe2\x89\xa4 300,000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n6\n1 2\n3 5\n3 4\n2 3\n5 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kefaa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CO92TREE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Disjoint Set Union, Bitmasking, Bitwise Operation, Greedy, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Mathematics, Bit Manipulation, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3004\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-03-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n4 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
