Unfortunately, the Dynamo shuffle is a little too complicated so Mathison decides to create his own shuffle.\n\n\n This newly invented shuffle is done in N steps. At step k (0 \xe2\x89\xa4 k < N) the deck is divided into 2k equal-sized decks\n where each one contains cards that lie on consecutive positions.\n Each one of those decks is then reordered: all the cards that lie on even positions are placed first followed by all cards that lie on odd positions\n  (the order is preserved in each one of the two subsequences and all positions are 0-based). Then all the decks are put back together (preserving the order of decks).\n\n\n Mathison has spent hours practising the shuffle and he now believes that he has perfected his technique. However, Chef doesn't believe him yet so he asks Mathison to answer Q questions that given a deck of size 2N where i-th card is labelled i, find the position of the card labelled K in the final, shuffled deck.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input file will contain one integer, Q, representing the number of Chef's questions.\nEach of the next Q lines will contain a pair of integers, N and K.\nOutput\nThe output file will contain Q lines, each one representing the answer to one of Chef's questions.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 64\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 K < 2N\nSubtaks\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10\nSubtask #2 (30 points):\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 32\nSubtask #3 (40 points):\nOriginal constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3 4\n3 3\n3 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n6\n2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n64 11047805202224836936\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1337369305470044825\n\n\nExplanation\nIn all questions, we have N = 3. Therefore, we have a deck with 8 cards.\nThe shuffling is done in three steps:\n\nStep 0: We divide {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} in 20 decks. We get only one deck.\n        The deck is reordered into {0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7}.\n\nStep 1: We divide {0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7} in 21 decks. We get two decks: {0, 2, 4, 6} and {1, 3, 5, 7}.\n        {0, 2, 4, 6} is reordered into {0, 4, 2, 6} while {1, 3, 5, 7} is reordered into {1, 5, 3, 7}.\n        We get {0, 4, 2, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7} when we put the decks back together.\n\nStep 2: We divide {0, 4, 2, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7} in 22 decks. We get four decks: {0, 4}, {2, 6}, {1, 5} and {3, 7}.\n        Each one of the four decks stays the same after it is reordered (as there are only two elements to reorder).\n        We get the final, shuffled deck: {0, 4, 2, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7}.\n\nThe card labelled 4 is on position 1.\nThe card labelled 3 is on position 6.\nThe card labelled 2 is on position 2.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85alexvaleanu\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MATDYS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 alexvaleanu, easy, ltime51, observation\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1920\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-08-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
