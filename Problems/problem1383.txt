b'\nDid you know that a cluster of bananas can also be called a \'hand\' of bananas ? No points for guessing what the individual bananas are called. ya.. \'fingers\' :). The monkey from the valley of food is all set to fight for the title \'Dragon Chef\' after having a hand of bananas for breakfast. As you know that the judge, master Oogway is always late for the show, the monkey and Po decided to play a game. They took a string of characters and started rotating it. A k-rotation on a string takes the trailing k characters of the string and attaches it to the beginning of the string in the same order. For eg. 3-rotation on the string "noodles" results in the string "lesnood". On the given string S, the monkey performs a M-rotation and gives it to Po. Po performs a P-rotation on it and gives back to the monkey. The monkey again performs a M-rotation on it and so on... Though Shifu is getting angry watching the monkey play with Po, he is wondering after how many minimum (non-zero) number of rotations we can get back to the original string S. This can happen after a rotation performed by the monkey or Po. Please find it for him.\n\nInput\nFirst line contains T ( number of test cases, around 10 ). T cases follow. Each case consists of two lines. First line has the string S of length n ( 1 <= n <= 500,000 ), having (\'a\'-\'z\' , \'A\'-\'Z\'). Second line contains two integers M P separated by a space ( 1 <= M, P <= n ). Comparisons are case sensitive i.e., \'a\' is not equal to \'A\'.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the answer in a new line. If its impossible to get back to the original string by performing the rotations as mentioned above, print -1\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\nAbcDef\n1 2\nabcabc\n1 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nCase 1 :\nMonkey : fAbcDe , Po : DefAbc, Monkey : cDefAb , Po : AbcDef\nCase 2 :\nMonkey : cabcab , Po : bcabca, Monkey : abcabc\nWarning : Large input / output.
