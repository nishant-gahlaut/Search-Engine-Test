b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian.\n\nSereja is hosting his birthday dinner. He invited his N close friends. Let us number the people from 1 to N according to the order in which they arrive at the event. The dinner is being held in long straight corridor in which people sit in a way such that they won't leave any empty space in between two consecutive persons at any given time. \n\n\nWhen a person number i arrives at the corridor, he must go and stand to the immediate right of the person numbered A[i] (if A[i] = 0, then this person just stands at the leftmost end of the line). \n\n\nBut there is a problem, as there is no space between two consecutive persons at any given time, so for this person to sit, space must be created by moving either all the persons to left of the place to the left one step each, or all the persons to right of the place to the right one step each.  \n\n\nNow, Sereja is wondering about what could be the minimum number of steps people will take so as to sit in the dinner party. Please find it fast, so that Sereja can peacefully entertain his guests.\n\nInput\nFirst line of input contain an integer T \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. T tests follow.\nFirst line of each test case contain the integer N, and the next line contains N integers \xe2\x80\x94 A[1], A[2], ... , A[N].\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line with the answer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimal number of steps required.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 A[i] < i\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1\n0\n3\n0 0 0\n5\n0 1 2 1 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n3\n\n\nExplanation\n\nExample case 3.\n\nFirst three persons don't need any steps to sit. The line after the arrangement of these persons will look like [1, 2, 3].  \nWhen person #4 comes in, he wants to sit to the right of person 1, so we need to either move the first person to the left, or the second and third persons to the right. The first case is clearly better. Now the line will look like [1, 4, 2, 3].  \nWhen person #5 arrives, he will need to move 2 persons in either case. The final arrangement will be [1, 4, 5, 2, 3]. \n\n\n\nSo total number of steps people moved during the entire process is 1 + 2 = 3. So the answer is 3. \n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsereja_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85iscsi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SEALINE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 1D Arrays, ad-hoc, Brute Force\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1806\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-11-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
