Upon collecting all seven of them, one can summon the divine dragon Shenron by chanting magical words. The dragon would then grant any one wish of the summoner.\nChef and his two friends Ramzz and Raju embarked on a journey to collect all seven magical dragon balls. After much difficulty, they have collected them all and proceeded to summon Shenron by chanting magical words. Upon arrival, Shenron told the three friends that he would grant their wish only if they solve the following problem.\nYou are given a sequence of integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN, on which you may perform operations of the following two types:\n\nChoose two consecutive odd elements and replace them by a single element \xe2\x80\x95 their sum. For example, the sequence [1,2,3_,3_,4] may be changed to [1,2,6_,4] (the replaced elements are underlined).\nChoose two consecutive even elements and replace them by a single element \xe2\x80\x95 their sum plus 1. For example, the sequence [1,2_,2_,3,4] may be changed to [1,5_,3,4].\n\nYour goal is to create a sequence whose length is the smallest possible. If there are multiple sequences with this minimum length, find the most beautiful one among them. (A sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AM is more beautiful than a sequence B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BM if there is a valid index i such that Ai<Bi and for each valid j<i, Aj=Bj.)\nHelp Chef and his friends Ramzz and Raju solve Shenron's problem.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print two lines.\n\nThe first of these lines should contain a single integer K \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest possible length of the final sequence.\nThe second line should contain K space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x95 the most beautiful final sequence with length K.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN are either all odd or all even\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2\n2 2\n3\n1 3 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n2\n1 8\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85ramzz\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SHENQ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Mathematics, Constructive, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3255\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-08-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
