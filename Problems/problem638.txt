b'\nChef loves bitwise operations. So, he creates the following problem but needs your help to solve it.\nChef calls a sequence of integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN tasty if it satisfies the following condition:\n\nparity(Ai&Ai+1)\xe2\x89\xa0parity(Ai|Ai+1) for 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<N.\n\nChef gives you a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. You may perform the following operation on the sequence any number of times (possibly 0): \n\nChoose 2 indices i and j (1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4n ; i\xe2\x89\xa0j) and change Ai to Ai\xe2\x8a\x95Aj.\n\nChef is asking you to make the sequence tasty using the minimum number of operations, or report that it is impossible.\nAs a friendly reminder,\n\nparity(x) denotes the remainder of dividing x by 2\n& denotes the bitwise AND operation\n| denotes the bitwise OR operation\n\xe2\x8a\x95 denotes the bitwise XOR operation.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case:\n\nIf it is impossible to convert the given sequence into a tasty sequence using the given operations, print a single line containing the integer \xe2\x88\x921.\nOtherwise, first, print a line containing a single integer M \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of operations you have to perform.\nThen, print M lines describing these operations in the order in which you want to perform them. For each k (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4M), the k-th of these lines should contain two space-separated integers i and j (1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4n ; i\xe2\x89\xa0j) \xe2\x80\x95 the indices on which the k-th operation is performed.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85103\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai<230 for each valid i\nThe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): Original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2\n0 0\n3\n6 16 69\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n-1\n1\n1 3\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: It is impossible to make A tasty using the given operations.\nTest case 2: We can choose i=1 and j=3 and apply the operation which converts A into [67,16,69] which is tasty.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85akshitm16\n\n\nTester:\n5\xe2\x98\x85tejas10p\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BITBLEND\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 akshitm16, bitwise-operation, easy, feb221\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1983\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-02-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
