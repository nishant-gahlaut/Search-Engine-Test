Chef wants to prepare a delicious cake for Gordon to impress him, but he does not know that Gordon Ramsay is not easy to impress.\nGordon cut Chef's cake into NN small slices (numbered 1 through N), placed in a row in such a way that for each valid i, slices i and i+1 are adjacent. Note that slices N and 1 are not adjacent. For each valid i, the i-th slice has taste Ai. Gordon wants to put special toppings on some slices and then ask Chef to group all slices into K clusters in such a way that the slices in each cluster form a contiguous sequence and the sweetness of the cake is maximum possible.\nFor each valid i, let's denote the topping on the i-th slice by ti (ti=0 if there is no topping on this slice); the sweetness of this slice is ti\xe2\x8b\x85Ai, so the sweetness of a slice without any special topping is 0.\nThe sweetness of a cluster is the total (summed up) sweetness of all slices in this cluster. Let's denote the sweetnesses of all clusters by S1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SK. The sweetness of the whole cake is computed as S1\xe2\x88\x97S2\xe2\x88\x97\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x88\x97SK, where the operation \xe2\x88\x97 is defined in the following way: for any non-negative integers x and y such that x\xe2\x89\xa5y,\nx\xe2\x88\x97y=y\xe2\x88\x97x=\xe2\x8c\x8alog2(x)\xe2\x8c\x8b\xe2\x88\x91n=02n(\xe2\x8c\x8ax2n\xe2\x8c\x8bmod2)(\xe2\x8c\x8ay2n\xe2\x8c\x8bmod2).\nIt can be proven that this operation is associative, i.e. (x\xe2\x88\x97y)\xe2\x88\x97z=x\xe2\x88\x97(y\xe2\x88\x97z).\nYou should answer Q queries. In each query, you are given the toppings on all slices and the number of clusters K. Tell Chef the maximum possible sweetness of the cake!\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nThe next line contains a single integer Q.\nFor each query, two lines follow. The first of these lines contains a single integer K. The second line contains N space-separated integers t1,t2,\xe2\x80\xa6,tN.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum sweetness.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41015 for each valid i\n0\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa410 for each valid i\nin each query, the number of slices with toppings does not exceed 50\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n10\n15 5 26 4 3 13 5 5 27 11\n2\n3\n2 3 1 4 7 1 5 1 1 1\n1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n33\n5\n\n\nExplanation\nFor the first query, Chef can choose clusters in the following way: cluster 1 contains slices 1 and 2, cluster 2 contains slices 3 through 7 and cluster 3 contains slices 8 through 10.
