b"\nIt's the 1st of the month again, which means it's time for Dave to pay his bills.\nDave needs to go to the post office to mail his rent cheque, and wants to take the\nshortest route possible.  Dave wonders how many different shortest routes he can take.\nDave lives at the southwest corner of town (0,0) and the post office is at the northeast corner of town (W,H).\nIt takes Dave exactly one minute to move from (x, y) to (x, y+1), (x, y-1), (x+1, y) or (x-1, y).\nDave cannot move further south or west than his house, nor can he move further north or east than the post office \n(that is, Dave's x coordinate must stay between 0 and W, and his y coordinate must stay between 0 and H at all times).\nAdditionally, there are N intersections that are being worked on by construction crews,\nand Dave must avoid these intersections.\nThe number of shortest routes may be very large, so print the result modulo 1000000037.\nIf it is impossible for Dave to reach the post office, the answer is 0.\nInput:\nInput begins with an integer T, the number of test cases.\nEach test case begins with 3 integers W, H, N.\nN lines follow, each containing 2 integers (xi, yi), the coordinates of an intersection being worked on by a construction crew.\nIntersections are guaranteed to be unique, and neither (0,0) nor (W,H) will be under construction.\nA blank line separates each test case.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output a line containing the number of shortest paths to the post office, modulo 1000000037.\nSample input:\n3\n\n2 2 1\n1 1\n\n1 1 2\n0 1\n1 0\n\n7 1 2\n1 0\n4 1\n\nSample output:\n2\n0\n6\n\nConstraints\n\n1<=T<=30\n1<=W,H<=107\n0<=xi<=W\n0<=yi<=H\n0<=N<=max(100,min(W,H,1000))\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndavid_adm\n\n\nTester:\n4\xe2\x98\x85anshuman_singh\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/POST\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 david_adm, hard, oct10\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2659\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-07-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.88 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
