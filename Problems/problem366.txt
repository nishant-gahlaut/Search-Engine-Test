b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has two integers AA and BB. He can perform the following operation on AA an arbitrary number of times (including zero):\n\nwrite AA as a binary number with an arbitrary number of leading zeroes (possibly without any)\nshuffle the binary digits of AA in an arbitrary way, obtaining a number ss\nreplace AA by s+1s+1\n\nChef is wondering about the minimum number of operations he has to perform on AA in order to obtain BB. Compute this number or determine that it is impossible.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers AA and BB. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of operations or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to obtain BB from AA.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa410180\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa41018\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): A,B\xe2\x89\xa427A,B\xe2\x89\xa427\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2 4\n1 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: One optimal solution is to not shuffle anything, so Chef just adds 11 twice. \nExample case 2: We can obtain 55 from 11 in one operation.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85sanroylozan\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bitwise Operation, Binary, Floyd Warshall's Algorithm, BFS, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Bit Manipulation, Number System, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Shortest Paths, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1747\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-05-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
