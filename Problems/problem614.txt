b'\nYou are given a sequence AA of N integers such that every element is a non-negative power of 2.\nA sequence is called good if its sum is a non-negative power of 2. You would like to turn A into a good sequence.\nTo achieve this, you can perform the following operation on A:\n\nPick a non-empty subsequence of A, pick a positive integer X such that X\xe2\x89\xa4230, and multiply every element of this subsequence by X.\n\nFind the minimum number of operations required to turn A into a good sequence. Also, find one sequence of operations which does this. If there are multiple possible answers, you may find any of them.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. \n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print the answer in the following format:\n\nFirst, print one line containing an integer M, denoting the minimum number of moves required.\nThen, print 2M lines describing M operations.\nEach operation is described by 2 lines.\nOn the first line, print two space-separated integers K and X, denoting the size of the subsequence and the multiplier for this operation.\nOn the second line, print K distinct space-separated integers denoting the indices of the elements chosen to be multiplied in this operation. These K integers can be printed in any order.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4220\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): Original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4\n4 8 4 32\n3\n2 2 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3 2\n1 2 3\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: Multiplying the 1st,2nd and 3rd elements by 2 turns the array into [8,16,8,32], whose sum is 64=26.\nTest case 2: The array is already good.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85prasant21\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/POWSUM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, jan222, prasant21\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1906\n\n\nDate Added:\n6-01-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
