b'\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nA string is called a Palpal string if it can be divided into contiguous substrings such that:\n\nEach character of the whole string belongs to exactly one substring.\nEach of these substrings is a palindrome with length greater than 11.\n\nFor example, "abbbaddzcz" is a Palpal string, since it can be divided into "abbba", "dd" and "zcz".\nYou are given a string ss. You may rearrange the characters of this string in any way you choose. Find out if it is possible to rearrange them in such a way that you obtain a Palpal string.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string ss.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if the characters of ss can be rearranged to form a Palpal string or "NO" if it is impossible (without quotes).\nYou may print each character of each string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa4100\nss contains only lowercase English letters\nthe sum of |s||s| over all test cases does not exceed 106106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\nacbbbadzdz\nabcd\nxyxyxy\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The string "acbbbadzdz" can be rearranged to "abbbaddzcz", which is the Palpal string mentioned above.\nExample case 2: It can be shown that "abcd" cannot be rearranged to form a Palpal string.\nExample case 3: The string "xyxyxy" is already a Palpal string, since it can divided into "xyx" and "yxy".\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85jeevanjyot\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PALPALS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, Constructive\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1776\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-02-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
