b'\nYou are given the following series:\nHi\n1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221, 1113213211, \xe2\x80\xa6\nWe have to find nth term of the given series. \nHINT: Please read the title of the problem.\nHINT2:\nWe are given first number as 1.\nWe have to keep the nth number as we say the (n-1)th number ALOUD. \nLike for example, 1st number contains "one times one" so 2nd number is "11".\n2nd number is 11 which is "two times one", hence 3rd number is "21".\n3rd number is 21 which is "one time two and one time one", hence 4th number is "1211".\n4th number is 1211, which is "1 times 1, 1 times 2, 2 times 1". Hence 5th number is "111221"\nInput:\n\nThe first and the only line contains NN \n\nOutput:\n\nThe output should be the nth term of the series.\n\nSample Input - 1:\n3\n\nSample Output - 1:\n21\n\nSample Input - 2:\n5\n\nSample Output - 2:\n111221\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa425\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n1\xe2\x98\x85yashrs\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SAYITOUT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 medium, yashrs\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-10-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
