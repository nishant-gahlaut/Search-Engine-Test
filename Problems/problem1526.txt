He decided to invite his friends Miron and Slava to come play it with him. \nThe board is a rectangular grid of size  2 \xc3\x97 N. Initially, Miron and Slava each put their chips at a location (x1,y1 ) and (x2,y2 ) respectively. The game then proceeds as follows : \n\n\n Each player moves their chip in turns.\n In each turn, a player can move his chip to an adjacent cell that has not been visited by the other player before.\n Two cells are adjacent if they share a side\n A player can also skip his turn\n The cell that is initially occupied by a particular player's chip is considered visited by him\n\n\n The outcome of the game is decided as follows : \n\n If a player manages to visit strictly more than half the total number of cells (i.e. visited at least N+1 cells), he immediately wins and the other player loses.\nif the game continued for more than 10100 turns without any player declared a winner yet then it becomes a draw.\n\n\nGiven that both players move optimally and Miron starts first, can you help Chef predict the winner of the game?\nInput\n The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case is described by a single line containing five space-separated integers N, x1, y1, x2, y2. \nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line with string Miron, Slava or Draw, denoting the answer to the problem.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4  105 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4  1018 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 x1, x2  \xe2\x89\xa4  2\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 y1, y2  \xe2\x89\xa4  N\nCells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are different.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n5 1 1 2 3\n1 1 1 2 1\n3 1 1 2 3\n4 1 2 1 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nSlava\nDraw\nDraw\nMiron\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nmelnik\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GAMSTICK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Case work, Game Theory\n                 \n                     \n                     Special, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2724\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-08-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
