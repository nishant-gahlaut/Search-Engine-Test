b'\nProblem Statement :\nKrushi and Mansi turn up to be the volunteers for the Coldplay concert. Chris Martin loved the crowd and hence provided Krushi and Mansi infinite number of Tshirts to giveaway to his fans.Both of them jump into the crowd. Chris Martin points to N number of fans one by one, first to Krushi then to Mansi.\nAssume infinite fans arranged in a 2D infinte grid, with each fan standing at each step systematically. Chris gives them directions in a form of a string S and they blindly follow them. Due to this few fans turn up having more than one Tshirt.\nKrushi and Mansi start at the same location (delivering two Tshirts to the same starting fan), then take turns alternatively based on instructions from Chris, who gives them command as follows :\nU - Move Up on step \nD - Move Down one step \nL - Move Left one step \nR - Move Right one step\n\nGiven the string S of commands provided by Chris. Output the number of lucky fans who got atleast one Tshirt. \n\nInput :\nFirst line of input contains integer N denoting the number of fans Chris points to.\nSecond line of input string S of length N containing only "U", "D", "L", "R" characters (all capital) denoting the commands by Chris.\n\nOutput :\nOutput the desired answer.\n\nContraints :\n1<=N<=10000\n\nExample 1 :\nInput :\n2\nUD\n\nOutput :\n3\nExplanation :\nKrushi and Mansi deliver 2 Tshirts to the fan at starting locations. Krushi goes Up one step and delivers one to the fan at that location, Mansi goes Down one step and delivers one the fan there. Therefore, 3 fans got atleast one Tshirt.\n\nExample 2 :\nInput :\n4\nULDR\n\nOutput :\n3\nExplanation :\nKrushi and Mansi return back where they started.\n\nExample 3 :\nInput :\n10\nRLRLRLRLRL\n\nOutput :\n11\nExplanation :\nKrushi goes in one direction and Mansi goes the other.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85vedipen\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COLDPLAY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, kpr22019, set, vedipen\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-09-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
