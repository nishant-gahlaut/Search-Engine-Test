b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nYou are given an unrooted tree with N nodes, numbered from 1 to N. Each edge of the tree has a positive integer, associated with it. Your goal is to calculate the number of unordered pairs (S, T) of tree's nodes such that the greatest common divisor of all the integers associated with the edges of the path between S and T is equal to one. Of course, we consider only the pairs where S isn't equal to T.\nYou are also given Q queries, where the ith query is described by two integer Ai and Ci. In the ith query, the number associated with the Aith edge will be changed Ci. You also want to calculate the answer for the tree after each query.\nInput\nThere is only one test case in one test file.\nThe first line of input contains an integer N, denoting the number of nodes in the tree. The ith line of the next N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains the description of ith edge, where the line has three space-separated integers X, Y and Z. It means that ith edge connect nodes X and Y, and the associated integer is Z. Then the next line contains an integer Q, denoting the number of queries. The ith line of the next Q lines has two space-separated integers Ai and Ci.\nOutput\nIn the first line, print the answer for the initial tree. Then print the answer for the tree after each query. Here the answer means that the number of unordered pairs (S, T) of the nodes such that the greatest common divisor of all the integers associated with the edges of the path between S and T is equal to one.\nConstraints and Subtasks\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 X, Y \xe2\x89\xa4 N, and X \xe2\x89\xa0 Y\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Z \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x88\x92 1\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ci \xe2\x89\xa4 106\nThe graph given in the input denotes a tree\n\n\nSubtask 1 (27 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 103\n\nSubtask 2 (73 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n1 2 10\n1 3 6\n3 4 15\n3 5 15\n2\n4 5\n1 7\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nThe below figure shows the initial graph and the graph after each query.\nThe initial tree. The sought pairs are (2, 4) and (2, 5). For example, in the path between nodes 2 and 4, there are three integers 10, 6, 15 associated edges, and GCD(10, 6, 15) = 1.\nAfter query 1. The sought pairs are (1, 5), (2, 4) and (2, 5).\nAfter query 2. The sought pairs are (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4) and (2, 5).\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsergey_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85laycurse\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TREECNT2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 GCD, Sieve of Eratosthenes, Mobius Function, Primes\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Mobius Inversion\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2841\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-02-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
