b'\n\nChef Ciel is going to organize a quiz game in her restaurant.\nCiel has N problems, and she will choose K problems for the quiz game.\nEvery participant has to answer all K problems.\n\n\nCiel thinks that if a participant solves all K problems correctly, the participant will get bored,\nand if a participant solves less problems correctly, the participant will feel sad.\nTherefore, Ciel decides to choose K problems maximizing the probability that participants will solve exactly K-1 problems correctly.\n\n\nThe N problems are numbered from 1 to N.\nCiel assumes, the problem i will be solved correctly with probability Pi% for each i, and these are statistically independent of each other.\n\n\nCan you tell what problems are chosen by Ciel?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.\nThen T test cases follow.\nThe first line for each test case has 2 integers N and K.\nThe next line has N integers P1, P2, ..., PN.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print K distinct integers denoting the numbers of chosen problems.\nIf there are multiple sets of problems maximizing the probability, then anyone will do.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 20\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 36\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Pi \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n\nSample Input\n4\n3 2\n70 80 90\n9 1\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\n1 1\n10\n10 5\n90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90\nSample Output\n1 2\n1\n1\n5 8 1 4 9\nOutput details\n\nIn the first case, all patterns choosing 2 problems are:\n  If problems 1 and 2 are chosen, the probability is 0.7 * (1 - 0.8) + (1 - 0.7) * 0.8 = 0.14 + 0.24 = 0.38\n  If problems 1 and 3 are chosen, the probability is 0.7 * (1 - 0.9) + (1 - 0.7) * 0.9 = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34\n  If problems 2 and 3 are chosen, the probability is 0.8 * (1 - 0.9) + (1 - 0.8) * 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26\nTherefore, Ciel will choose problems 1 and 2.\n\n\nIn the fourth case, there are multiple solutions. Any 5 distinct intergers from 1 to 10 will be accepted.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nhiroto_adm\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85shangjingbo\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CIELQUIZ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Probability, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2460\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-11-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.253304 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
