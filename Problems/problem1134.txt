b"\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nYou are given a sequence of integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. This sequence is circular \xe2\x80\x95 for each valid ii, the element Ai+1Ai+1 follows after AiAi, and the element A1A1 follows after ANAN.\nYou may insert any positive integers at any positions you choose in this sequence; let's denote the resulting sequence by BB. This sequence is also circular. For each pair of its elements BsBs and BfBf, let's denote the (non-circular) sequence created by starting at BsBs and moving from each element to the one that follows after it, until we reach BfBf, by B(s,f)B(s,f). This sequence includes the elements BsBs and BfBf.\nFor each KK from 22 to NN inclusive, find the smallest possible number of elements that need to be inserted into AA to form a sequence BB for which there is no subsequence B(p,q)B(p,q) such that:\n\nThe size of B(p,q)B(p,q) is at least KK.\nThere is no pair of consecutive elements in B(p,q)B(p,q) such that their GCD is equal to 11.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 space-separated integers.
