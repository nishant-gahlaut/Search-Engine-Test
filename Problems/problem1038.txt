There are NN vertical obstacles in the room (numbered 11 through NN); for each valid ii, the coordinates of the endpoint of the ii-th obstacle are (xi,ai)(xi,ai). There are two types of obstacles: \n\nType 0: A line segment between the points (xi,0)(xi,0) and (xi,ai)(xi,ai), i.e. upwards from the floor.\nType 1: A line segment between the points (xi,H)(xi,H) and (xi,ai)(xi,ai), i.e. downwards from the ceiling.\n\nFor each obstacle, you need to find the number of endpoints of other obstacles (not including itself) that are visible from its endpoint. Two endpoints are visible from each other if the line segment joining them does not intersect or touch any other obstacle. Note that each obstacle has exactly one endpoint.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers HH and NN.\nThe following NN lines describe the obstacles. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers titi, xixi and aiai, where titi is the type of the ii-th obstacle.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these integers should be the number of endpoints visible from the ii-th endpoint.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4200\n1\xe2\x89\xa4H\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4H\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42,000\nti\xe2\x88\x88{0,1}ti\xe2\x88\x88{0,1} for each valid ii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4H\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4H\xe2\x88\x921 for each valid ii\nno two obstacles touch or intersect\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 20,00020,000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n10 4\n0 2 5\n1 5 6\n1 8 8\n0 11 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2 3 2 3\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85smartnj\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TOWCNT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Geometry\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2648\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-04-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
