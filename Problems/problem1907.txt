b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nMr. Yagami is playing a game of numbers. He has two arrays, each of size N denoted by A1,A2...AN and B1,B2...BN.\nNow, he has to make a move each minute. Let us maintain two sets S1 and S2 which are empty intially.\nIn one move , first he'll pick a pair of indexes (i, j) such that it's already not present in S1. Also, Bj > Ai and GCD(Ai,Bj) is not 1. Further, he'll pick another pair of indices (p, q) such that it's already not present in S2. Also, Bp < Aq and GCD(Aq,Bp) is not 1. Also, GCD(Aq,Bp) should not be coprime to GCD(Ai,Bj). And, he'll add both pair of indices to S1 and S2, respectively.\n\nHelp Mr. Yagami by printing the largest number of moves he can perform.\nInput\nFirst line contain T, the number of testcases. Each testcase consists of N in one line, followed by two lines of N space separated integers each, denoting arrays A and B, respectively.\nOutput\nFor each testcase, print the maximum number of moves Mr. Yagami can make, in one line.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 400\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai, Bi \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n4\n2 5 6 14\n3 4 7 10\n2\n2 3\n5 7\n\nOutput:\n3\n0\n\n\nExplanation\n\nFirst testcase:\nFollowing are the possible moves denoting by (i,j) and (p,q)\n1st move: (1,2) and (2,3)\n2nd move: (1,4) and (2,4)\n3rd move: (3,4) and (4,4)\nIn any possible combination not more than 3 moves are possible.\n\nSecond testcase:\nNo move is possible.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85darkshadows\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GNUM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Maximum Flow, Number Theory\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos, Flow Networks, Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2521\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-05-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
