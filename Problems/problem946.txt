b"\nSardar Khan has finally decided to attack Ramadhir - he will bomb one of Ramadhir's businesses in Wasseypur. Sardar Khan knows that Ramadhir has NN businesses (numbered 11 to NN) and that there are N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 roads connecting pairs of these businesses in such a way that all businesses are connected. Further, Sardar knows that each business has a specific value - the ii-th business has value AiAi.\nWhen Sardar Khan destroys a business, he also destroys every road directly connected to it.\nFormally, destroying business vv also destroys all existing roads of the form (u,v)(u,v).\nSardar thinks that the damage dealt to Ramadhir upon destroying business vv equals the sum of the greatest common divisors of every remaining maximal connected set of businesses. More formally,\n\nLet the connected components of the graph obtained on deleting vv and edges incident to it be C1,C2,\xe2\x80\xa6,CkC1,C2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ck.\nDefine gcd(Ci)gcd(Ci) to be gcd(Ai1,Ai2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Air)gcd(Ai1,Ai2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Air) where CiCi consists of vertices i1,i2,\xe2\x80\xa6,iri1,i2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ir.\nThe damage caused by destroying vv is then \xe2\x88\x91ki=1gcd(Ci)\xe2\x88\x91i=1kgcd(Ci).\n\nSardar Khan wants to maximize the damage he deals. Can you find the maximum possible damage he can achieve, given that he destroys exactly one business?\nIf the process of computing damage is still unclear, please refer to sample test cases for an explained example.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer TT, denoting the total number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NN, denoting the number of businesses Ramadhir owns.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains 22 integers aa and bb, denoting a road between businesses aa and bb.\nFinally, the last line of each test case contains NN space-separated positive integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN, where AiAi is the value of the ii-th business.\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing one integer - the maximum possible damage that Sardar Khan can deal.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\nSum of NN over all test cases will not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055\xe2\x8b\x85105.\nIt is guaranteed that the given roads connect every business.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n3 5\n4 6 8 12 15\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\nExplanation\n\nIf business 11 is bombed, the remaining connected components are {(2),(3,4,5)}{(2),(3,4,5)}. This gives a damage of gcd(A2)+gcd(A3,A4,A5)=6+1=7gcd(A2)+gcd(A3,A4,A5)=6+1=7.\nIf business 22 is bombed, the remaining connected components are {(1,3,4,5)}{(1,3,4,5)}. This gives a damage of gcd(A1,A3,A4,A5)=1gcd(A1,A3,A4,A5)=1.\nIf business 33 is bombed, the remaining connected components are {(1,2),(4),(5)}{(1,2),(4),(5)}. This gives a damage of gcd(A1,A2)+gcd(A4)+gcd(A5)=2+12+15=29gcd(A1,A2)+gcd(A4)+gcd(A5)=2+12+15=29.\nIf business 44 is bombed, the remaining connected components are {(1,2,3,5)}{(1,2,3,5)}. This gives a damage of gcd(A1,A2,A3,A5)=1gcd(A1,A2,A3,A5)=1.\nIf business 55 is bombed, the remaining connected components are {(1,2,3,4)}{(1,2,3,4)}. This gives a damage of gcd(A1,A2,A3,A4)=2gcd(A1,A2,A3,A4)=2.\n\nClearly, bombing business 33 gives the maximum possible damage, that being 29.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85dhananjay_777\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DLTNODE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Pre processing, GCD, DFS, Euler Tour, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Algorithms, Mathematics, Number Theory, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2190\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-09-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
