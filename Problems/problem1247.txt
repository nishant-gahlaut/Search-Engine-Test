b'\n\nGiven N and M Dexter wants to know how many pairs a,b(1 <= a < b <=N) are there such that (a+b) is divisible by M.\nFor example when N=4 and M=3, there are 2 possible pairs the sum of which is divisible by M  and they are (1,2) and (2,4).\n\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of input contains T(<=100000) which is the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains two integers N(1 <= N <= 10^9) and M(2 <= M <= 10^9).\n\nOutput\n\nOutput one line per testcase, the number of pairs (a,b) as described before.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 3\n4 3\n1 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nimran_adm\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85subra\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DIVPAIR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Modular Arithmetic\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1835\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-03-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.27 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
