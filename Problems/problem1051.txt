A unit of number N is defined as a subset formed from the factors of N. As the answer may be large, output it modulo 10^9+7.\n\n\nInput\nFirst line contains an integer T indicating the number of test cases.\nFirst line of every test case contains an integer N .\nOutput\nFor every test case,print the answer in a new line.\nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <= 100000\n1 <= N <= 100000\n\nExample\nInput\n2\n4\n6\nOutput\n29\n167\n\nExplanation\nN=4\nans=(1+2+4+1*2+1*4+2*4+1*2*4)%(10^9+7)=29\nN=6\nans=(1+2+3+6+1*2+1*3+1*6+2*3+2*6+3*6+1*2*3+1*3*6+2*3*6+1*2*6+1*2*3*6)%(10^9+7)=167\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85himkha_100\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COWA19C\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cowr2020, easy, himkha_100, pre-computation, sieve\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-01-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
