b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese and Vietnamese as well.\nLet\'s define a 10-string as a string that contains only characters \'1\' and \'0\', starts with \'1\' and ends with \'0\'. For example, "10101010", "100" or "1010" are 10-strings, while "011", "11120" or "10101" are not.\nA subsequence of any 10-string is called humongous if it is of the form "1010...10" ("10" concatenated an arbitrary number of times).\nFor example, the 10-string "110" contains exactly 2 humongous subsequences and "1010" contains exactly 4 humongous subsequences (formed using indices {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {1, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}).\nYou should process some really humongous queries. Each query is as follows:\n\nYou\'re given a 10-string S and an integer X.\nYou should convert S into another 10-string U by flipping a number of characters (possibly zero; a flip means changing a \'1\' to \'0\' or \'0\' to \'1\') of S.\nThe string U should contain exactly X humongous subsequences.\nThe answer to the query is the minimum number of flips that need to be performed. If it\'s impossible to convert S into a valid string U, the answer doesn\'t exist.\n\n\nNote that U has to be a 10-string.\nFor each query, compute the minimum possible number of flips or determine that there is no answer.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single string S.\nThe second line contains a single integer X.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nIf there is no answer, print a single line containing one string "NO" (without quotes).\nIf an answer exists, print two lines.\nThe first line should contains a single string "YES" (without quotes).\nThe second line should contain a single integer denoting the minimum necessary number of flips.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4 32\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 X \xe2\x89\xa4 106\nS will be a 10-string\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (15 points):\n\n|S| \xe2\x89\xa4 20\nX \xe2\x89\xa4 103\n\n\nSubtask #2 (85 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1110\n4\n110\n1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\n1\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: We can convert the given 10-string into U = "1010" using only one flip; this string has exactly 4 humongous subsequences. This is the minimum possible number of flips.\nExample case 2: The only 10-strings we can obtain after any number of flips are "100" and "110". Each of them contains exactly 2 humongous subsequences, so there is no answer.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85include_sajal\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/XYHUMOQ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Euclid\'s Algorithm, Recursion, Constructive, Meet in the middle\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, GCD, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2712\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-11-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
