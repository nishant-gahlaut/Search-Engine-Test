b'\n\xc2\xa0\nPoornima College is having N branches, where each branches have positive integral student. A minimize operation is performed on the branch such that all of them are reduced by the minimum number student in a branch.\n\n\nSuppose we have 5 branches and all of them have below students in a branch.\n\n\n5 2 4 2 6\n\n\nThen in one minimize operation we reduce all the branch by 2 students. For next minimize operation 3 branch are left (have non-zero student), whose value are\n\n3 2 4\n\nAbove step is repeated till no students are left in all branches.\n\nGiven students of N branches, print the number of student that are reduce in subsequent minimize operation.\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer N.\n\nThe next line contains N integers : X(0), X(1), X(2),..... X(N-1) separated by space, where X(i) represents the student of ith branch..\nOutput\n\nFor each minimize operation, print the number of students that are reduced in branches in separate line.\n\nConstraints\nShould contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:\n\n1 <= N <= 1000\n1 <= X(i) .\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n1\xe2\x98\x85dvlpr_expert\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 array, dvlpr_expert, maths, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-03-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
