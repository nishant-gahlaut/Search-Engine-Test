She views two sequences with length N as identical if, after they are sorted in non-decreasing order, the i-th element of one sequence is equal to the i-th element of the other sequence for each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N).\nTo impress Chefina, Chef wants to make the sequences identical. He may perform the following operation zero or more times: choose two integers i and j (1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4N) and swap Ai with Bj. The cost of each such operation is min(Ai,Bj).\nYou have to find the minimum total cost with which Chef can make the two sequences identical.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nThe third line contains N space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum cost, or \xe2\x88\x921 if no valid sequence of operations exists.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,Bi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (15 points):\n\nT\xe2\x89\xa420\nN\xe2\x89\xa420\n\nSubtask #2 (85 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1\n1\n2\n2\n1 2\n2 1\n2\n1 1\n2 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n-1\n0\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: There is no way to make the sequences identical, so the answer is \xe2\x88\x921.\nExample case 2: The sequence are identical initially, so the answer is 0.\nExample case 3: We can swap A1 with B2, which makes the two sequences identical, so the answer is 1.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85rishup_nitdgp\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHFNSWPS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Maps, Greedy\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-01-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
