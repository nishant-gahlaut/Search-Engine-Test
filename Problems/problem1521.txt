He performed HulkHulk SmashSmash on the set P which caused the points to change, and so he obtained a new set of points P\xe2\x80\xb2.\nMore formally, Hulk Smash makes the new set P\xe2\x80\xb2 in the following way:\n\nInitially, let P\xe2\x80\xb2 be empty.\nFor every Pi and Pj such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4N , add the mid point of Pi and Pj to the set P\xe2\x80\xb2 (only if it didn't exist in it already).\n\nSo, P\xe2\x80\xb2 is the set of midpoints of line segments connecting pairs of distinct points of P.\nNote that points from P do not necessarily have to be in P\xe2\x80\xb2. See the samples below for a graphical example.\nFind the number of points of P\xe2\x80\xb2 which lie on the convex hull of P\xe2\x80\xb2. A point is said to lie on the convex hull if the shape of the convex hull is changed when this point is removed.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N, denoting the size of P.\nThe next N lines contain two space-separated integers each, where the i-th line contains Pi.x,Pi.y denoting the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the i-th point. \n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the number of points of P\xe2\x80\xb2 which lie on its convex hull.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa420\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\xe2\x88\x925\xe2\x8b\x85108\xe2\x89\xa4Pi.x,Pi.y\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85108\nThe convex hull of the input set P has positive area\nSum of N over all tests cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask 1 (20 points):\n\nSum of N over all test cases does not exceed 103\n\nSubtask 2 (80 points):\n\nOriginal constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n7\n1 7\n-6 -5\n1 -6\n-6 7\n-4 3\n-2 6\n-3 -6\n4\n1 8\n1 4\n1 0\n5 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8\n4\n\n\nExplanation\n\nIn the below images, the set of points P is denoted by the color pink, the set of points P\xe2\x80\xb2 is denoted by the color green. The blue point is the origin.\nThe below image represents the first test case\n\nThe below image represents the second test case\n\n\nNote that by our definition, points (1,4) and (3,4) are not considered to lie on the convex hull of P\xe2\x80\xb2, because removing one of them does not change the shape of the hull.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85dragonado\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CONHULK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sets, Convex Hull, Sorting, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Computational Geometry, Polygons, Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2938\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-11-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
