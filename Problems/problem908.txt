b"\nChef's friend JJ challenged him to construct a tree which has exactly RR red coloured nodes, GG green coloured nodes and BB blue coloured nodes.\nTo make the task interesting he added an extra condition: the simple path between any two blue nodes should contain at least one red node and at least one green node.\nCan you help Chef to complete JJ's challenge by constructing any valid tree that satisfies these conditions? \nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains RR, GG, and BB - the number of red, green and blue nodes respectively in the tree.\n\nOutput Format\n\nIf a tree can be constructed that fulfils all the requirements then\nIn the first line, output a string of length R+G+BR+G+B in which the ithith character (1-based indexing) is either R, G or B denoting the colour of the ithith node as red, green or blue respectively.\nIn the following R+G+B\xe2\x88\x921R+G+B\xe2\x88\x921 lines, output two integers UU and VV denoting there is an edge between UthUth and VthVth node.\nIf no tree fulfils the requirements print -1 in a single line. \n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n3\xe2\x89\xa4R+G+B\xe2\x89\xa410003\xe2\x89\xa4R+G+B\xe2\x89\xa41000\nR,G,B\xe2\x89\xa51R,G,B\xe2\x89\xa51\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1 1 1\n1 1 2\n1 2 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nRBG\n1 2\n1 3\nBRGB\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\n\nTest case 11: There is only one blue node. Hence, any valid tree with 11 red, 11 green and 11 blue node will pass the conditions.\nTest case 22: There are two blue nodes numbered 11 and 44 and the simple path between them passes through one red node numbered 22 and one green node numbered 33. Hence, this tree is valid. \nTest case 33: No valid tree can be constructed under the given constraints.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85jeevanjyot\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85aryanc403\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RGBCONST\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Bipartite Graphs, Pigeonhole Principle, Bipartite\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Mathematics, Set Theory, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Coloring\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2256\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-12-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
