b'\nMoEngage noticed that some users are not aware of the practice page on CodeChef, and some others are not aware of the rated contests on CodeChef. So, MoEngage wants to send an email to the users depending on which of the following groups they fall into:\n\nIf the user has never submitted on the practice page then send an email with the text:\nhttps://www.codechef.com/practice\nIf the user has submitted on the practice page, but never participated in a contest then send an email with the text:\nhttps://www.codechef.com/contests\nIf the user has submitted on the practice page as well as participated in a contest then send an email with the text: \nhttps://discuss.codechef.com\nso that they may discuss with other members of the community.\n\nHelp MoEngage by writing a program that takes as input two integers A and B where: \n\nA=1 if the user has submitted on the practice page and 0 otherwise.\nB=1 if the user has participated in a contest and 0 otherwise.\n\nOutput the appropriate link to be displayed in the email.\nInput Format\n\nThe input consists of a single line with two space-separated integers A and B.\n\nOutput Format\n\nPrint one of the following strings as per the problem statement.\nhttps://www.codechef.com/practice\nhttps://www.codechef.com/contests\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com \n\nConstraints\n\nA is either 0 or 1.\nB is either 0 or 1.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.codechef.com/practice\n\n\nExplanation\nThe user has not submitted on the practice page, so the program must output the link to the practice page.\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.codechef.com/contests\n\n\nExplanation\nThe user has submitted on the practice page, but has not participated in a contest, so the program must output the link to the contest page.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsrikkanth_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFPAGES\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cakewalk, cook140, easy, implementation, srikkanth_adm\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n719\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-04-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
