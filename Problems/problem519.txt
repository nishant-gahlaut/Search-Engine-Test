The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and K.\nN lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains M space-separated integers Ai,1,Ai,2,Ai,3,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ai,M.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of K-worthy submatrices of A.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x8b\x85M\xe2\x89\xa4106\nN\xe2\x89\xa4M\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4109\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ar,c\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid r,c\nthe sum of N\xe2\x8b\x85M over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (15 points): the sum of N\xe2\x8b\x85M over all test cases does not exceed 103\nSubtask #2 (25 points): the sum of N\xe2\x8b\x85M over all test cases does not exceed 4\xe2\x8b\x85105\nSubtask #3 (60 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3 3 4\n2 2 3\n3 4 5\n4 5 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The following are the seven 4-worthy submatrices:\n\n[3445]\nwith average 4; this matrix occurs only once\n[4555]\nwith average 4.75; this matrix also occurs only once\n[4]\nwith average 4; we find this matrix twice in A\n[5]\nwith average 5; we find this matrix 3 times in A\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85shaanknight\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/KAVGMAT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 april21, binary-search, easy, shaanknight, two-pointers\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1817\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-02-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
