In one such dream, Mario is given an array aa of length nn, and a number kk. He performs as many operations as he wants to this array; in the end, he wants to make every element divisible by kk.\nIn a single operation, Mario selects two indices ii and jj (in particular, he can choose i=ji=j), and does a[i]=a[i]+a[j]a[i]=a[i]+a[j].\nHelp Mario decide if he can make everything divisible by kk eventually, thus ending his dream.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers nn and kk.\nThe second line contains nn space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AnA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,An.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing "YES" if everything can be made divisible by kk eventually, and "NO" if not.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\nSum of nn across all testcases is \xe2\x89\xa4106\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\nSubtasks\n\n30 points: Sum of nn across all testcases is \xe2\x89\xa4104\xe2\x89\xa4104\n70 points: Original constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n    3 2\n    3 4 3\n    5 6\n    6 6 8 7 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\n    NO\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: We can make everything divisible by 22 in 22 steps. In the first step, choose i=1,j=1i=1,j=1, which gives the array 66 44 33. Then, choose i=3,j=3i=3,j=3 which gives the array 66 44 66.\nExample case 2: It is not possible to make everything divisible by 66 through any sequence of moves.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85theoneyouwant\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DREDIV\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-01-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
