b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nYou work as an engineer. You were given an empty board with KK consecutive cells; at any moment, each cell can display one character.\nYou want the board to display a string S with length N>K. Since the board isn\'t large enough, you want to display the string in N\xe2\x88\x92K+1 steps. In the i-th step (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x92K+1), you\'ll make the board display the characters Si,Si+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Si+K\xe2\x88\x921.\nThe power required to switch the board from step i to step i+1 (for 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x92K) is equal to the number of characters displayed on the board that have to change between these steps. You should find the total power required for the whole process of displaying a string, i.e. the sum of powers required for switching between all consecutive pairs of steps.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.\nThe second line contains a single string S with length N.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the total power required for text switching.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K<N\neach character of S is a lowercase English letter\nthe sum of N for all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa450\n\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n6 3\naabbcc\n5 2\nabccc\n4 3\naabb\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n3\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n\nIn step 1, the board is displaying "aab".\nIn step 2, the board is displaying "abb".\nIn step 3, the board is displaying "bbc".\nIn step 4, the board is displaying "bcc".\n\nThe power required for switching from the 1-st to the 2-nd step is 1, because cell 1 changes from \'a\' to \'a\' (requiring power 0), cell 2 changes from \'a\' to \'b\' (requiring power 1) and cell 3 changes from \'b\' to \'b\' (requiring power 0); 0+1+0=1.\nThe power required for switching between the 2-nd and 3-rd step is 2 and the power required for switching between the 3-rd and 4-th step is 1.\nTherefore, the answer is 1+2+1=4.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85isaf27\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SUMPOWER\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1709\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-06-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
