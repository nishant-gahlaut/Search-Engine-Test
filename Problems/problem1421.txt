b'\n\nByteland is a kingdom of islands. Alice has N maps of the different islands constituting Byteland. Map of each island consists of cities, connected by roads. Being Byteland, the road layout of each island has a binary tree structure. Each island has a capital, which is the root of the binary tree of its map. \n\n\nAlice is bored and plays the following game:\nShe chooses k out of these N maps and places a robot on the capital city of each map. Every robot is controlled by a common control string. If the present character of the control string is L(R), then all the robots move to the left(right) subtree on their map. All the robots follow the same control string and move on their respective maps. \n\n\nA control string is valid with respect to a given map if it corresponds to a valid path on that map. A control string is considered valid for a given set of k maps if it is valid for each of the k chosen maps. \n\n\nFor example in a complete binary tree of 3 nodes, control strings "L" and "R" are valid and "LL" is an example of an invalid control string.\n\n\nAlice is interested in knowing the longest control \nstring which is valid for at least k maps, for each value of k. Can you find this for her?\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of input contains an integer t (t<=5), the number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer M (1<=M<=100), the number of maps. Then M maps description follow.\nThe ith map description starts with an integer N (2<=N<=1000), the number of cities on the island. Each of the following N-1 lines contain two space separated integers u c v (1<=u,v<=N , c=L or R) which means a road between city u and city v on the ith island and if c is L(R) then v is in the left(right) subtree of u. The capital city of each island is the city with number 1.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output M space separated integers, where the ith integer denotes the length of the longest valid control string she can obtain assuming she can choose i maps.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n5\n1 L 2\n1 R 3\n3 L 4\n3 R 5\n4\n1 R 2\n1 L 3\n2 L 4\n3\n1 L 2\n1 R 3\n2\n5\n1 L 2\n2 L 3\n3 L 4\n4 L 5\n6\n1 L 2\n2 R 3\n3 L 4\n4 R 5\n5 L 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2 2 1\n5 1\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nakhil_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85pieguy\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TR2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Binary Tree, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Tree Data Structure, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1754\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-04-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.237612 - 0.61675 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
