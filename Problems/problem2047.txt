Initially, all cells of this matrix contained 00-s. Let\'s denote a cell in row rr and column cc by (r,c)(r,c).\nSakshi is well-known for troubling others. This time, her friends Nikki and Mansi planned to take revenge and teach her a lesson, so they changed her matrix by performing the following operation QQ times:\n\nChoose any valid cell (x,y)(x,y).\nAdd 11 to all the cells in row xx.\nAdd 11 to all the cells in column yy.\n\nThen, Nikki and Mansi challenged Sakshi to find the total number of ways to perform a sequence of QQ operations on the initial matrix such that at the end, exactly ZZ cells in the matrix contain odd integers. Sakshi is not good at math, since she has spent all her life troubling others, so this time, she really needs your help. Help Sakshi count the number of ways. Since the answer may be large, compute it modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.\nNote: Two ways to perform a sequence of operations are considered different if there is a valid ii such that the cell chosen in the ii-th operation in one sequence is different from the cell chosen in the ii-th operation in the other sequence. For example, if we choose the cells (1,1)(1,1) and (2,2)(2,2) in this order, it is different from choosing the cells (2,2)(2,2) and (1,1)(1,1).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers NN, MM, QQ and ZZ.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of ways to perform a sequence of operations modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa42,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa42,000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Z\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x8b\x85M0\xe2\x89\xa4Z\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x8b\x85M\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa410181\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41018\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,Q\xe2\x89\xa43001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,Q\xe2\x89\xa4300\nSubtask #2 (40 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa43001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4300\nSubtask #3 (10 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa45001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4500\nSubtask #4 (10 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa46001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4600\nSubtask #5 (10 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa47001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4700\nSubtask #6 (10 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa48001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4800\nSubtask #7 (10 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2 2 2 0\n2 2 2 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8\n8\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: If we start by choosing the cell (1,1)(1,1), the matrix becomes\n2 1\n1 0\n\nNow we have two options ? we can choose either even-valued cell.
