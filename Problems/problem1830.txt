b'\nCivil students of Technical Club have prepared a map for the students which lists down the available paths between different areas in BBD. The map mentions information about $N$ areas and $K$ distinct routes that interconnects them. Also travelling from one area to another always takes $1 minute$ in the map, if there is a direct route between those two areas.  B11 class  is planning a mass bunk today in which they will go from a source area $S$ to another area $D$ using the TC map. Before moving, Bhawna wishes to find the minimum time required to travel from area $S$ to area $D$. The only student who is good in calculations is Deepak (CR of class) but he is busy solving a math question.  So you have to help Bhawna find minimum time to reach $D$ from $S$ (in minutes).\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain two integers $N, K$. Number of areas and the routes in the TC  map.   \nThen next $K$ lines have two space separated strings $A1, A2$. A route between $A1$ and $A2$.  \n$K+1$ line has two space separated strings $S, D$. The source and destination for mass bunk.\n\nOutput:\nA single integer $T$ answering the minimum time required to travel from $S$ to $D$.\nConstraints\n\n$2 \\leq N \\leq 10$\n$N \\leq K+1 \\leq 100$\n\nSample Input:\n3 2   \n\nNITM NIIT\nBBDU NIIT\nNITM BBDU\nSample Output:\n2\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThey will take 1 minute in path NITM -> NIIT and 1 minute in path NIIT -> BBDU. Hence 2 minutes is answer\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85h4wk\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MAPTC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 breadth-first-search, cwtc2020, graphs, h4wk, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n6-06-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, PYPY, NODEJS, PHP, GO, JS\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
