b"\nDave is having trouble choosing problems for the upcoming cook-off.\nThe admins will be mad at him if he doesn't select problems with a gradually increasing level of difficulty.\nTo make his task easier, Dave has assigned a difficulty rating to each problem he has written.\nA difficulty gap is defined as the absolute difference in difficulty rating between 2 problems,\nwhere there is no other problem with a difficulty rating between them.\nFor example, if problems are chosen with difficulty ratings of 4, 7, 13, and 19, then the difficulty\ngaps are 3, 6, and 6.\nDave has already chosen 2 problems for the cook-off,\nand wants to choose the remaining problems in a way that minimizes the largest difficulty gap.\n\nInput\nInput begins with an integer T, the number of test cases.\nEach test case begins with 4 integers N M C1 C2 on a line.\nN is the number of problems to choose from (not including the two already chosen problems).\nM is the number of problems that must be chosen (in addition to the two that have already been chosen).\nC1 and C2 are the difficulty ratings of the 2 problems that have already been chosen.\nFollowing this is a line with exactly N integers, giving the difficulty ratings of the remaining problems.\nAgain, the 2 already chosen problems are not included in the values of N and M.\nA blank line separates each test case, including a blank line after the number of test cases.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output on a single line the minimum possible value of the largest difficulty gap.\nSample Input:\n3\n\n3 1 0 100\n16 45 61\n\n5 0 50 80\n20 40 60 80 100\n\n6 3 0 100\n21 64 34 55 64 89\n\nSample Output:\n55\n30\n34\n\nContsraints\nT\xe2\x89\xa4250\n0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000\nAll difficulty ratings are between 0 and 1000000, inclusive.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndavid_adm\n\n\nTester:\nfriggstad\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COOKOFF\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Case work, Greedy, Sorting, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Special, Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2255\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-11-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.75 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
