b'\nShefin gives you a string S and you have to find a non-empty string P such that:  \n\nP is a substring of S.\nNo non-empty substring of P is a prefix of S.\nNo non-empty substring of P is a suffix of S.\n\nFor all such possible strings, find the length of the longest string satisfying all the conditions. If no such string is possible, print \xe2\x88\x921. \nA string A is a substring of a string B if A can be obtained from B by deleting several (possibly zero) characters from the beginning and several (possibly zero) characters from the end.\nA prefix of a string A, is a substring of A that occurs at the beginning of A. For example, "code" is a prefix of "codechef", but "ode" is not.\nA suffix of a string A, is a substring of A that occurs at the end of A. For example, "chef" is a suffix of "codechef", but "he" is not.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T - denoting number of test cases.\nEach test case contains a string S consisting of lowercase english alphabets only. \n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single integer. If a string P exists based on the given conditions, print the maximum length of the possible string. Otherwise, print \xe2\x88\x921.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4|S|\xe2\x89\xa4106\nSum of |S| over all test cases does not exceed 106.\nS consists of lowercase english alphabets only.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\nabcdab\naaa\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: The maximum length of the string satisfying all required conditions is 2. The string cd satisfies all the conditions. It can be proven that no string of length greater than 2 exists which can satisfy all the conditions.  \nTest Case 2: There is no string possible which satisfies all the required conditions. Thus, the answer is \xe2\x88\x921.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85rifatrraazz\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SUBSTRING\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, Two pointers\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1442\n\n\nDate Added:\n6-03-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
