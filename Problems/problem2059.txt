They must do so in such a manner that:\n\nAlice and Bob get at least one gift each\neach gift is given to at most one of the children, as they do not like to share\nthe sum of values of the gifts Alice gets is equal to the sum of values of gifts Bob gets\n\nGiven NN and the values of all gifts, help Mr. and Mrs. J distribute the gifts or state that it is impossible to distribute them in a way that satisfies all conditions.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aNa1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nIf it is impossible to distribute the gifts in the desired way, print a single line containing the string "NO" (without quotes).\nOtherwise, print two lines. The first of these lines should contain the string "YES" (without quotes). The second line should contain a single string with length NN. For each valid ii, the ii-th character of this string should be:\n\'A\' if the ii-th gift is given to Alice\n\'B\' if the ii-th gift is given to Bob\n\'N\' if the ii-th gift is given to charity\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa451\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41081\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4108 for each valid ii\n\nExample Input\n2\n5\n3 2 4 5 2\n2\n10 70\n\nExample Output\nYES\nNABNA\nNO\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Alice receives gifts with total value 2+2=42+2=4.
