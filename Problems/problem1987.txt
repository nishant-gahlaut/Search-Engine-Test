Let us define the strength of a forest as the sum of squares of sizes of its connected components. (Clearly, a tree with n nodes has strength n2.)\n\nChef has found a tree with N nodes on day 0. On each of the next N-1 days, he's going to remove one edge. Let's denote the forest that remains after i days by Fi, for each 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N-1; also, let's denote the original tree by F0. On day i, Fi is created by randomly uniformly choosing one edge from Fi-1 and removing it.\n\n\nLet Ei be the expected value of strength of the forest Fi, for each 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N-1. It can be proven that this number can be written in the form Pi / Qi, where gcd(Pi, Qi) = 1 and gcd(Qi, 109 + 7) = 1. Let Ri = Pi \xc2\xb7 Qi-1 mod 109 + 7, where Qi-1 denotes the modular inverse of Qi modulo 109 + 7.\n\n\nFind the values of R0, R1, ..., RN-1.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer N \xe2\x80\x94 the number of nodes in the tree.\nN-1 lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting an edge between nodes u and v in the tree.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single line containing N space-separated integers R0, R1, ..., RN-1.\n\nConstraints\n\n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105 \n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 u, v \xe2\x89\xa4 N \n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (25 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 103\nSubtask #2 (75 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n25 16 333333346 7 5\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85jtnydv25\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CUTTREE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Centroid Decomposition, Expected Value, FFT\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos, Mathematics, Probability, Transformations\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2744\n\n\nDate Added:\n31-12-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
