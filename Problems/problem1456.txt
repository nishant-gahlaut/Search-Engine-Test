b'\nThe Big Billion day has arrived and Ross has $N$  items in his mind which he wants to purchase. \nAfter purchasing Ross found that he has total of $M$ type items from 1 to $M$. \nNow to distinguish the items from each other he wants to arrange them in such a way that items of same type occur continuously. \nFor this he can select any $K$ ( $0$ <= $K$ <= $N$ ) number of items and permute them. The other $N-K$ elements remain untouched. \nCan you help him to find the minimum value of $K$ for which this is possible? \nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space separated integer $N$ and $M$\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers which denotes the type of items he has bought as \n$A_1$, $A_2$, . . . . . $A_N$ . \n\nOutput:\nPrint a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94  minimum value of $K$ for which items of same type occurs continuously. \nConstraints\n\n$1 \\leq N \\leq 100000$\n$1 \\leq M \\leq 20$\n$1 \\leq A_i \\leq M$\n\nSample Input:\n6 3\n1 2 3 1 2 3\n\nSample Output:\n3\n\nEXPLANATION:\nOne of the possible way is to select the items at indexes $1st$ , $3rd$ and $5th$.\nWe can permute the selected items by placing the $1st$ ,$3rd$ and $5th$ items at $3rd$ ,$5th$ and $1st$ places respectively to finally get 2 2 1 1 3 3. \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85aditya10_\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ENG5\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bitmasking, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Bit Manipulation, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2396\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-12-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
