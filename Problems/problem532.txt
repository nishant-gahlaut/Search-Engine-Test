b'\nRead problems statements in Russian and Bengali.\nYou are given an integer N. Output a permutation of values from 1 to N that satisfies the following condition:\n\ngcd([1+A1,2+A2,3+A3,\xe2\x80\xa6,N+AN])>1\n\nIt can be proven that a solution always exists. If there are multiple permutations that can satisfy the condition, then output any one of them.\nAs a reminder,\n\nA permutation of values from 1 to N is an array containing integers from 1 to N in any order but each of them appearing exactly once.\nGCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor. The greatest common divisor of a sequence is the largest integer d such that all the numbers in sequence are divisible by d.

The T test cases then follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer N.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output on one line a permutation of values from 1 to N which satisfies the above condition.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4500\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4500\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3 4 1 2\n\n\nExplanation\n\nFor the first test case, gcd([1+3,2+4,3+1,4+2])=gcd([4,6,4,6])=2 which is greater than 1, so the given permutation satisfies the condition.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85munch_01\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FAKEGCD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 GCD, ad-hoc, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1362\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-09-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
