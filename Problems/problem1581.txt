b"\nA wireless network has been built consisting of many wireless access points for computers.\nEach access point can support a certain number of computers, and the network will perform better\nwhen computers are close to the access points supporting them.\nSpecifically, the greatest distance between any computer and its access point determines the\nstrength of the network.\nA network has recently been designed that will automatically reconfigure itself every time a computer\nis added so that the greatest distance will be as small as possible.\nYour task is to compute, as each computer is added to the network, this distance.\nConsider the following example:\nThere are 2 access points, at (5,5) and (6,9), each of which can support 2 computers.\nThe first computer to be added to the wireless network is at (3,5).\nThis computer connects to the access point at (5,5), which is only a distance of 2 away.\nThe next computer to be added is at (5,2).\nThis computer also connects to the access point at (5,5), and the greatest distance is now 3.\nA third computer is added at (4,2).\nThis computer cannot connect to the (5,5) access point because it has already reached its limit.\nBut connecting to (6,9) is not a good choice either because its so far away.\nInstead, the network reassigns the (3,5) computer to the (6,9) access point so that the new computer\ncan connect to the (5,5) access point.\nThe greatest distance is now from the (3,5) computer to the (6,9) access point, which is 5.\n(Note: in the picture below, the top-left corner is (0,0)).\nInput\nInput begins with an integer T, the number of test cases to follow.\nEach test case begins with a line containing 2 integers, S (the number of access points)\nand C (the number of computers).  S+C lines follow.  The first S lines contain 3 integers each,\ngiving the coordinates of an access point, followed by the number of connections it can support.\nThe next C lines contain 2 integers each, giving the coordinates of a computer.  \nThere is a blank line before each test case.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output C lines, where the i'th line contains the greatest distance\nin the network after the first i computers have been added to the network, rounded to 3 decimal places.\nOutput a blank line after each test case.\nConstraints\nT is between 1 and 15, inclusive.\nS is between 1 and 30, inclusive.\nEach access point supports between 1 and 30 connections, inclusive.\nC is between 1 and the total number of supported connections, inclusive.\nAll coordinates comprise integers between 0 and 10000, inclusive.\nAll coordinates are distinct.\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n2 3\n5 5 2\n6 9 2\n3 5\n5 2\n4 2\n\n2 4\n3 6 2\n10 9 2\n2 5\n3 8\n4 3\n6 4\n\n2 1\n10 5 1\n6 8 1\n3 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2.000\n3.000\n5.000\n\n1.414\n2.000\n7.071\n7.071\n\n5.831\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndavid_adm\n\n\nTester:\n1\xe2\x98\x85gamabunta\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/NETWORK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Flow Networks, Floyd Warshall's Algorithm\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Shortest Paths\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2184\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-04-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.313726 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
