b"\nChef is playing a game on the non-negative x-axis. It takes him 1 second to reach from ith position to (i\xe2\x88\x921)th position or (i+1)th position. The chef never goes to the negative x-axis. Also, Chef doesn't stop at any moment of time.\nThe movement of chef can be described as follows.\n\nAt the start he is standing at x=0 at time 0.\nIn the first round, he moves towards x=1 and comes back to the x=0 position. \nIn the second round, he moves towards the x=2 and comes back again to x=0. \nGeneralizing, in the kth round, he moves from x=0 to x=k and then returns back to x=0 at the end of the round. This goes on as the game progresses.\n\nFor Example, the path of Chef for 3rd round is given below.\n0\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x922\xe2\x88\x923\xe2\x88\x922\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x920 \nThe overall path followed by Chef would look somewhat like this:\n0\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x920\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x922\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x920\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x922\xe2\x88\x923\xe2\x88\x922\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x920\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x922\xe2\x88\x923\xe2\x88\x924\xe2\x88\x923\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xa6\nYou are given two non-negative integers N and K. You have to tell the time at which Chef arrives at x=N for the Kth time. \nNote - Chef can not skip a position while visiting the positions.\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains T the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case contains a single line of two integers N and K.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer -- the time taken by the chef to arrive at x=N for the Kth time by modulo 1,000,000,007.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n0 1\n1 1\n2 1\n1 3\n4 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n4\n5\n46\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1:\nChef starts the journey from the N=0 at time t=0 and it's the first time (K=1), he is here. So, the answer is 0.  \nTest Case 2:\nChef starts the journey from the N=0 at time t=0 then goes to N=1 at t=1 and it's the first time (K=1), he is here. So, the answer is 1.\nTest Case 4:\nThe path followed by Chef to reach 1 for the third time is given below.\n0\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x920\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x922\xe2\x88\x921\nHe reaches 1 for the third time at t=5.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85rishup_nitdgp\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RECNDNUM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Arithmetic, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Basic Maths, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1985\n\n\nDate Added:\n31-12-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
