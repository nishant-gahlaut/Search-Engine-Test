b"\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\nIn Banasthali, we feel like a family. Every festival is celebrated with great zeal and enthusiasm; so is Dushhehra.\nEvery year, the Banasthalites get really excited about watching the firework show on Dushhehra. \nThis year, Shreyasi has taken up the responsibility and is given a box of crackers.\nShe has been told that the box contains 'n' types of crackers, where each type of cracker occurs exactly twice except for one 'Special Cracker'. \nEach type of cracker is associated with some number which can be considered as elements of an array. Note that, there is no case where there wont be a 'Special Cracker'.\nGiven a box of crackers, help Shreyasi find the 'Special Cracker'. \nINPUT FORMAT\nThe first line contains a single integer 't' representing the number of test cases. \nThe next 2*'t' lines contain a single integer 'n' denoting the number of crackers in the box, followed by 'n' space-separated integers a[i] indicating the numbers associated with the crackers in the box.\nOUTPUT FORMAT\nPrint the 'Special Cracker' that occurs only once in the box.\nCONSTRAINTS\n1 <= t <= 100\n1 <= n <= 10^5\n1 <=a[i]<=10^5\nSAMPLE INPUT\n1 \n3\n2  2  3 \n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\n3\n\nEXPLANATION\nIn the given case, there are three crackers. The first two are of the type-2 and the third is of type-3. This is the special cracker- the only cracker with type-3.\nTherefore, 3 is the answer. \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85kaushambi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SPECRK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 bit-manipulation, bitf2016, easy, kaushambi, xor\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-12-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
