It is also guaranteed that for each valid ii, Ai+A1\xe2\x89\xa5Ai+1Ai+A1\xe2\x89\xa5Ai+1.\nAlice and Bob want to play QQ independent games using this sequence. Before they play these games, Alice should choose a positive integer GG between 11 and MM (inclusive). The rules of each game are as follows:\n\nThere is a set SS of positive integers representing allowed moves in this game. For each valid ii, in the ii-th game, this set is S={ALi,ALi+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ARi}S={ALi,ALi+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ARi} (in other words, given by a contiguous subsequence of AA).\nThe game is played with a single pile. Let's denote the number of objects in this pile by PP. At the beginning of the game, P=GP=G. In other words, Alice and Bob play all the games with the same initial number of objects that Alice chooses.\nThe players alternate turns; Alice plays first.\nIn each turn, the current player must choose a positive integer bb from the set SS such that b\xe2\x89\xa4Pb\xe2\x89\xa4P and remove bb objects from the pile, i.e. change PP to P\xe2\x88\x92bP\xe2\x88\x92b.\nWhen the current player cannot choose any such integer bb, this player loses this game.\n\nBoth players play optimally. You need to find the maximum number of games Alice can win if she chooses GG optimally.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, QQ and MM.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nQQ lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers LiLi and RiRi.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum number of games Alice can win.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q,M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q,M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41081\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4108 for each valid ii\nAi+A1\xe2\x89\xa5Ai+1>AiAi+A1\xe2\x89\xa5Ai+1>Ai for each valid ii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Li\xe2\x89\xa4Ri\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4Li\xe2\x89\xa4Ri\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of QQ over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of MM over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (5 points): \n\nN,Q,M\xe2\x89\xa4400N,Q,M\xe2\x89\xa4400\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 400400\nthe sum of QQ over all test cases does not exceed 400400\nthe sum of MM over all test cases does not exceed 400400\n\nSubtask #2 (30 points): \n\nN,Q,M\xe2\x89\xa45,000N,Q,M\xe2\x89\xa45,000\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 5,0005,000\nthe sum of QQ over all test cases does not exceed 5,0005,000\nthe sum of MM over all test cases does not exceed 5,0005,000\n\nSubtask #3 (65 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3 2 10\n2 3 4\n1 2\n2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The set of allowed moves in the first game is S={2,3}S={2,3} and in the second game, it is S={3,4}S={3,4}.
