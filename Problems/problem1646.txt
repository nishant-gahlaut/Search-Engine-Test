b"\nYou are given a single integer N. It's very large, so it's given as a product of several prime powers: N\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0p1k1\xc2\xa0p2k2\xc2\xa0...\xc2\xa0pmkm.\n\nLet's define \xcf\x86(N) as Euler's totient function -- the number of positive integers less than or equal to N that are relatively prime to N.\n\nLet N1 = \xcf\x86(N). Let N2 = \xcf\x86(N1). Further, let NX = \xcf\x86(NX-1) for X > 2.\n\nYour task is to find the smallest positive integer X such that NX = 1. Only careful calculation might help... or will it be enough?\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input file contains one integer T -- the number of test cases (no more than 10). Each test case is described by a line containing one positive integer m followed by m lines, each containing two integers pi and ki (1 < pi < 100000, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ki \xe2\x89\xa4 109) separated by a single space. It's guaranteed that all pi are pairwise distinct prime numbers in each test case (note that the upper limit on m can be determined from this constraint).\n\nOutput\nFor each test case output just one line containing the required smallest positive integer X.\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n2\n2 2\n3 1\n\nOutput:\n3\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the example test case N = 22*31 = 12. Then N1 = 4, N2 = 2 and NX = 1 for X \xe2\x89\xa5 3, so the answer is 3.\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\nAuthor:\ngennady_adm\n\n\nTester:\n4\xe2\x98\x85chmel_tolstiy\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CAREFUL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sets, Euler Totient Function, Sieve of Eratosthenes, Prime Divisors\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Mathematics, Number Theory, Integer Factorisation, Divisors\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2344\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-01-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.392183 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
