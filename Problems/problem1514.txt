b'\n\nYou have just begun his job with Educated Guessing Pollsters. An election is only weeks away and the company would like to get a general idea of how the voters feel about \nthe candidates. They asked a (probably not) random subset of N voters to submit a ranking of the M candidates.\nSay the candidates are numbered from 1 to M. \nA ranking is then a permutation of the set {1,2,...,M} listed as:\n\nc_1 c_2 ... c_M\n\nThe list is such that the voter prefers candidate c_i to candidate c_j if i > j. Your task is to determine a ranking R = r_1, r_2, ..., r_M such that the total number of disagreements with all voters who were polled is minimized.\n\n\nMore precisely, for a voter V we say the distance d(V,R) between voter V and ranking R is precisely the number of pairs (i,j) with 1 <= i < j <= M such that V actually prefers candidate r_i over candidate r_j. Say there are N voters labeled V_1, V_2, ..., V_n. The task is then to find a ranking R such that the sum\n\nd(V_1, R) + d(V_2, R) + ... + d(V_n, R) \n\nis minimized.\n\nInput:\nThe first line of input consists of a single integer T \xe2\x89\xa4 25 indicating the number of test cases to follow.\n\n\nEach test case begins with two integers N and M on a single line where N represents the number of voters and M represents the number of candidates. The following N lines contain th\ne rankings of the voters, one per line.\n\n\nEach ranking is given as a permutation c_1, c_2, ..., c_M of the numbers 1,2,...,M where consecutive numbers are separated by a space. In this ranking, c_i is preferred over c_j by precisely when i > j.\n\n\nA blank line appears between test cases (including a blank line just before the first test case).\n\n\nThe bounds are 1 <= N <= 1000 and 1 <= M <= 15.\n\nOutput:\nEach test case has a single line of output of the following form:\n\n\nD: r_1 r_2 ... r_M\n\n\nWhere D is the sum of the distances between the optimum ranking and the input rankings and r_1, r_2, ..., r_M is a ranking of the same form as the input rankings that achieves this\n minimum distance. If there are multiple such orderings, then output the one that minimizes r_M. Among those that minimize r_M, you should output the one that minimizes r_{M-1} and  so on.\n\n\n(note that in the second case that the ranking 1 2 3 also has total distance 4, but 2 1 3 is output based on the rules outlined in the output specification)\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n2 3\n1 2 3\n1 2 3\n\n4 3\n1 2 3\n2 1 3\n1 2 3\n3 2 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0: 1 2 3\n4: 2 1 3\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nzac_adm\n\n\nTester:\n4\xe2\x98\x85anshuman_singh\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/VOTING\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 NP Hard, Recursion, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, NP, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1941\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-04-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.93545 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
