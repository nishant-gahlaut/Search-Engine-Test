b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nDaniil is a royal gardener. He takes care of a garden with N plants numbered 1 through N. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the initial height of the i-th plant is Ai. Unfortunately, the Queen doesn't like the garden, so she asked Daniil to cut some plants \xe2\x80\x94 in order to satisfy the Queen's request, the i-th plant should have height Bi (for each 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N).\nDaniil is allowed to perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times (including zero):\n\nLet's denote the current heights of plants by H1,H2,\xe2\x80\xa6,HN.\nChoose two indices L and R (1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N) and a new height h such that h\xe2\x89\xa4Hi for each i between L and R inclusive.\nCut plants L through R down to height h, i.e. change the height of plant i to h for each L\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4R.\n\nSome time ago, Daniil was one of the best competitive programmers. Therefore, he is interested in the minimum number of operations needed to satisfy the Queen's request. Can you help him?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of plants.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN denoting the initial heights of plants.\nThe third line contains N space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN denoting the final heights of plants.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of operations needed to obtain the desired sequence of heights or \xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,Bi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): \n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nthe initial heights of all plants are identical\n\nSubtask #2 (30 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nSubtask #3 (40 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n3\n3 1 3\n2 1 2\n7\n1 3 4 5 1 2 3\n1 2 1 2 1 1 1\n3\n2 3 9\n2 3 9\n2\n1 2\n2 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n0\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\nDaniil can perform two operations: reduce the height of the first plant to 2 and reduce the height of the third plant to 2. Note that it is not possible to reduce the heights of all three plants to 2 in one operation, because the second plant's height is less than 2. We need two operations, thus the answer is 2.\nExample case 2:\nIn the first operation, cut the plants in the interval [2,4] down to height 2. Afterwards, cut the third plant down to height 1. Finally, cut the plants in the interval [6,7].\nExample case 3:\nAll plants already have the desired heights, so the answer is 0.\nExample case 4:\nIt is impossible to achieve the desired sequence of heights.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85step_by_step\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CUTPLANT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Deque, Segment Trees, Square Root Decomposition, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Queues, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2172\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-01-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
