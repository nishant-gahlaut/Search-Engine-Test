b"\nToday is Andrew's birthday.\nHe has invited N friends for celebrating it, and now he needs to prepare the table for them. All his friends will be sitting in a row on the seats numbered from 1 to N, inclusive. There are M different types of meatballs (numbered from 1 to M, inclusive). Andrew is going to serve meatballs of exactly one type at each of the seats.\nYou are an given array A of N integers in range [0, M]. Ai = 0 means that Andrew is not sure which type of meatballs he should serve at seat i. So, in this case, we consider seat i will be served meatballs of types from 1 to M with equal probability. Otherwise, Ai \xe2\x89\xa5 1 means that seat i will be served meatballs of type Ai.\nIt's very important for Andrew to know, what is the expected maximal number of consecutively sitting friends with the same type of meatballs served at their seats. Help Andrew to find this number.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a real number, denoting the expected value of maximal number of consecutively sitting friends with the same type of meatballs served to their seats.\nThe output values will be considered as correct if and only if they have the absolute errors at most 10\xe2\x88\x926.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 50\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 M\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n2 2\n0 0\n4 7\n0 1 1 0\n\nOutput:\n1.500000000\n2.285714286\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: There are 4 possibilities (with equal probability) of the serving as follows.1 1 : maximal number of consecutive seats with the same type = 21 2 : maximal number of consecutive seats with the same type = 12 1 : maximal number of consecutive seats with the same type = 12 2 : maximal number of consecutive seats with the same type = 2Therefore the answer is 2 * (1/4) + 1 * (1/4) + 1 * (1/4) + 2 * (1/4) = 1.5.\nExample case 2: There are 49 possibilities of the serving. Among these, the patterns with maximal number of consecutive seats with the same type = 3 are the following 12 patterns1 1 1 x, where x = 2, 3, ..., 7x 1 1 1, where x = 2, 3, ..., 7and the pattern with maximal number of consecutive seats with the same type = 4 is the following 1 pattern1 1 1 1In other 36 patterns, maximal number of consecutive seats with the same type = 2. Therefore the answer is 2 * (36/49) + 3 * (12/49) + 4 * (1/49) \xe2\x89\x88 2.2857.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85witaliy_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85laycurse\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LEFEED\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Expected Value, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Probability, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2425\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-03-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
