b'\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThe MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. For instance:\n\nThe MEX of [2,2,1][2,2,1] is 00, because 00 does not belong to the array.\nThe MEX of [3,1,0,1][3,1,0,1] is 22, because 00 and 11 belong to the array, but 22 does not.\nThe MEX of [0,3,1,2][0,3,1,2] is 4 because 0,1,20,1,2 and 33 belong to the array, but 44 does not.\n\nFind the maximum possible MEX of an array of non-negative integers such that the bitwise OR of the elements in the array does not exceed XX.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains TT denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case contains a single integer XX on a single line.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output on a single line the maximum possible MEX of the array satisfying the given property.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask 1 (100 points): Original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n0\n1\n2\n5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n2\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: The array could be [0][0]. \nTest case 22: The array could be [0,1][0,1]. Here the bitwise OR of 00 and 11 is 11 and the MEX of the array is 22 as both 00 and 11 belongs to the array.\nTest case 44: The array could be [1,0,3,2][1,0,3,2]. Here the bitwise OR of all integers in the array is 33 and the MEX of the array is 44.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85soumyadeep_21\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MEXOR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Logarithm\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1650\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-09-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
