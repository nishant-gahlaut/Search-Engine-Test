b'\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThe MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. For instance:\n\nThe MEX of [2,2,1] is 0, because 0 does not belong to the array.\nThe MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2, because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not.\nThe MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 because 0,1,2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not.\n\nFind the maximum possible MEX of an array of non-negative integers such that the bitwise OR of the elements in the array does not exceed X.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case contains a single integer X on a single line.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output on a single line the maximum possible MEX of the array satisfying the given property.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask 1 (100 points): Original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n0\n1\n2\n5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n2\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: The array could be [0]. \nTest case 2: The array could be [0,1]. Here the bitwise OR of 0 and 1 is 1 and the MEX of the array is 2 as both 0 and 1 belongs to the array.\nTest case 4: The array could be [1,0,3,2]. Here the bitwise OR of all integers in the array is 3 and the MEX of the array is 4.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85soumyadeep_21\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MEXOR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Logarithm\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1650\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-09-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
