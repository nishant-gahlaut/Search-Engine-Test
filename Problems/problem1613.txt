Currently she is investigating a massive murdering case in Bake Street.\n\n\nBake Street is composed of n buildings in a straight line. They are numbered from 1 to n, as you move from left to right. The i-th building is at position  xi  and has height hi. The buildings are so thin that we can consider them as vertical segments.\nThe murderer climbed to the top of one of the buildings and shot at all the buildings to the right, which had a lesser height than the building on which he was, and which were in his line of sight.\n\n\nAda is interested in the rightmost building that was shot by the murderer. Since we don't know the building from which the murderer was shooting, your task is to calculate it for every possible initial position.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains one number T, the number of test cases. T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n, the number of buildings.\nThe next n lines contains two integers xi, hi. the position and height of the i-th building.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase print n integers: ai, the rightmost building shot at, if the murderer started at building i. If the murderer didn't shoot to any building, print -1.\n\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 xi, hi \xe2\x89\xa4 106\nxi < xi+1, for all 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i < n \nNo two different buildings are of the same height\nThe sum of n over all test cases is at most 5 * 105\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n7\n1 130\n65 110\n120 40\n160 60\n240 100\n280 65\n320 30\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5 5 -1 -1 7 7 -1\n\n\nExplanation\n\n\nThe lines of shooting are shown in the figure above.\nFrom building 1, buildings 2 and 5 are shot. As the rightmost is building 5, that is the answer for building 1. Note that from building 1 is not possible to shoot at building 4 (dotted line) because building 2 obstructs the line of sight.\nFrom building 2, buildings 3, 4 and 5 are shot. From building 3 and 4, no building is shot at. Hence the third and fourth outputs are -1.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85alei\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85deadwing97\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ADADET\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Convex Hull\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Computational Geometry, Polygons\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2834\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-05-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
