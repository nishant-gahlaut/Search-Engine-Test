b'\nChef has the NN numbers 1,2,3,\xe2\x80\xa6,N1,2,3,\xe2\x80\xa6,N. He wants to give exactly KK of these numbers to his friend and keep the rest with him.\nHe can choose any KK numbers such that the GCD of any number from Chef\'s set and any number from his friend\'s set is equal to 11.\nFormally, suppose Chef gives the set of numbers AA to his friend and keeps BB with himself (where |A|=K|A|=K and |B|=N\xe2\x88\x92K|B|=N\xe2\x88\x92K). Then AA and BB must satisfy\ngcd(a,b)=1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x88\x80a\xe2\x88\x88A,b\xe2\x88\x88Bgcd(a,b)=1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x88\x80a\xe2\x88\x88A,b\xe2\x88\x88B\nChef needs your help in choosing these KK numbers. Please find any valid set of KK numbers that will satisfy the condition, or tell him that no such set exists.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK. \n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case first output a single line containing "YES" (without quotes) if a set of size KK satisfying Chef\'s condition exists; and "NO" if no such set exists. This line is not case-sensitive so "YeS", "nO", etc. are also acceptable. \nNext, if the answer is "YES", print another line containing KK distinct space-separated integers from 11 to NN denoting the numbers which Chef will give to his friend. The integers can be printed in any order.\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x921\nSum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x88\x971055\xe2\x88\x97105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n4 1\n4 2\n6 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYes\n3\nYes\n4 2\nNo\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: Chef can give [3][3] to his friend and keep [1,2,4][1,2,4] for himself. 33 is coprime with 1,21,2 and 44 so the condition is satisfied. Another possible solution is Chef giving [1][1] to his friend.\nTest case 22: Chef can give [2,4][2,4] and keep [1,3][1,3] (or vice versa). It can be seen that gcd(2,1)=1gcd(2,1)=1, gcd(2,3)=1gcd(2,3)=1, gcd(4,1)=1gcd(4,1)=1, gcd(4,3)=1gcd(4,3)=1 and so the condition is satisfied.\nTest case 33: There is no set of 3 numbers that can satisfy the given condition.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85tejas10p\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PARPERM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sieve of Eratosthenes, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2202\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-11-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
