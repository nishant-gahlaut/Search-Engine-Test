b'\nYou are given two positive integers aa and bb. You also have a number xx, which is initially set to 00. At first, you can add aa to xx any number of times. After that, you can divide xx by bb any number of times as long as xx is divisible by bb.\nPrint YES if you can make xx equal to 11, otherwise print NO.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line of input will contain TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case contains a single line, two positive integers a,ba,b.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output on one line YES if it is possible to make xx , or NO if it is not possible to do so. \nOutput is case insensitive, which means that "yes", "Yes", "YEs", "no", "nO" - all such strings will be acceptable.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n3 10\n9 6\n7 30\n8 12\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 22: We initially have xx set to 00. Add a=9a=9 to xx for 44 times to make xx equal to 3636. And then divide xx by b=6b=6 for 22 times to make xx equal to 11.\nTest case 44: We initially have xx set to 00. Add a=8a=8 to xx for 1818 times to make xx equal to 144144. And then divide xx by b=12b=12 for 22 times to make xx equal to 11.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nutkarsh_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ADDNDIV\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Number Theory, Basic Maths\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1935\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-09-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
