b"\n\nToday, Ciel's restaurant is closed.\nCiel is bored, so she decides to take a walk randomly.\n\n\nThis town has N intersections and M one way roads.\nThe i-th road connects from the Ai-th intersection to the Bi-th intersection.\nCiel is in the 1st intersection now, and Ciel's house is in the N-th intersection.\n\n\nIf Ciel is in the i-th intersection, she will take a walk as follows:\n\n\nIf i = N, her walk is ended.\nOtherwise, she chooses an integer k such that Ak = i uniformly randomly, she walks along the k-th road.\n\n\nOn the way, S intersections have beautiful flowers.\nLet the F1-th intersection, the F2-th intersection, ..., and the FS-th intersection have beautiful flowers.\nCan you tell the probability that Ciel last sees the flowers in the Fi-th intersection?\nThat is to say, can you tell the probability that she visits the Fi-th intersection, then she goes to N-th intersection without visiting other intersections having beautiful flowers?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains 3 integers N, M and S.\nThen, next line has S integers F1, F2, ..., FS.\nNext M lines have 2 integers each, Ai and Bi.\n\nOutput\n\nAn output should contain S lines.\nIn the i-th line, print the probability that Ciel last sees beautiful flowers at the Fi-th intersection.\nThese values must have an absolute error no more than 10-6.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 S < N \xe2\x89\xa4 30\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 F1 < F2 < ... < FS < N\nAi \xe2\x89\xa0 Bi\nIf i \xe2\x89\xa0 j and Ai = Aj, then Bi \xe2\x89\xa0 Bj\nFor each 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i < N, Ciel can go from the i-th intersection to the N-th intersection, directly or indirectly.\n\nSample Input 1\n4 6 3\n1 2 3\n1 2\n2 1\n1 3\n3 1\n2 4\n3 4\nSample Output 1\n0\n0.5\n0.5\nSample Input 2\n4 6 1\n2\n1 2\n2 1\n1 3\n3 1\n2 4\n3 4\nSample Output 2\n0.6666666666667\nSample Input 3\n2 1 1\n1\n1 2\nSample Output 3\n1\nNotes\n\nThe sum of output values can be less than 1, because Ciel may go back to her house without seeing beautiful flowers.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nhiroto_adm\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85shangjingbo\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CIELWALK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cook17, hard, hiroto_adm\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3137\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-11-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.345763 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
