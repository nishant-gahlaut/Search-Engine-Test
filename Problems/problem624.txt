b'\nChef recently created a new Tiling Window Manager called ChefWM. He wants to find out the maximum number of columns of windows he can fit on the screen and he needs your help.\nConsider the screen to be an axis-aligned rectangle in the xyxy-plane, with its bottom-left corner at (0,0)(0,0) and top-right corner at (N,M)(N,M) (that is, the screen has width N units and height M units). ChefWM works as follows:\n\nFirst, the screen is divided into one or more columns of equal integer width.\nThen, each column is divided into two or more windows of equal integer height. Note that all windows within a column must have the same height, but windows in different columns may have different heights.\nFinally, Chef would like the following condition to hold:\nNo two windows from different columns can have their horizontal boundary share the same y-coordinate (apart from y=0 and y=M). See the figures below for more details.\n\nIt is not allowed to leave any empty space on the screen, i.e, the division performed in the first two steps above must cover the entire screen.\nHere is an example of a tiling that satisfies all the conditions, for N=8 and M=6.\n\nBelow are two tilings that satisfy all conditions except the last. The one on the left has a horizontal edge at y=2 in both columns, while the one on the right has a horizontal edge at y=2 in column 1 and column 3.\n\n\nWhat is the maximum number of columns that ChefWM can fit on the screen while following the above conditions? Note that you do not need to maximize the number of windows, you only need to maximize the number of columns.\nIt may be possible that no columns can be created under these conditions, in that case, print 0.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nEach test case consists of a single line of input, containing two space-separated integers N,M \xe2\x80\x94 the coordinates of the top-right corner of the screen.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of columns ChefWM can create for the screen.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4500\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n8 210\n1 100\n100 5\n10 1\n9 2310\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n1\n1\n0\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: It is possible to make 4 columns as follows:\n\nThe first column has 7 windows of height 30 each\nThe second column has 2 windows of height 105 each\nThe third column has 5 windows of height 42 each\nThe last column has 3 windows of height 70 each\n\nIt can be seen in the diagram below that the edges from any two windows from different columns do not have the same y-coordinate except for y=0 and y=m.   \n\nTest Case 2: There can only be one column no matter how many windows you keep (as long as there are at least 2 windows).\nTest Case 3: You can have a single column with 5 windows. It can be shown that this is the maximum number of columns that can possibly satisfy the given restrictions.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85pranavreddyp16\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85lavish315\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFWM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Prime Divisors, Pigeonhole Principle\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Set Theory, Integer Factorisation, Divisors\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1955\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-12-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
