b"\nYou are given a tree with $N$ vertices. The vertices are numbered from $1$ to $N$. Some of the vertices are colored black and some are colored red. Also, some vertices can be uncolored. There is at least one black and at least one red vertex.\nCompute the number of subsets of vertices $W$ such that:\n\nEach vertex in $W$ is uncolored.\n$W$ is a connected subgraph of the tree.\nIf you remove all the vertices of set $W$, there will be at least one pair of vertices $(u, v)$ such that $u$ is black and $v$ is red, and there is no path from $u$ to $v$.\n\nOutput your answer modulo $10^{9} + 7$.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of vertices.\nEach of the next $N - 1$ lines contains two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$ denoting an edge between vertices $u$ and $v$.\nThe next line contains $N$ space-separated integers denoting the colors of the vertices. The $i^{th}$ of these integers is $0$ if vertex $i$ is uncolored, $1$ if it's black, or $2$ if it's red.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer denoting the number of ways to select a valid subset $W$, modulo $10^{9} + 7$.\nConstraints\n\n$1 \\leq T \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^{5}$\n$2 \\leq N \\leq 10^{5}$\n$1 \\leq u, v \\leq N$\nSum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed $10^{6}$\n\nExample Input\n2\n6\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n3 5\n3 6\n0 1 0 1 2 0\n6\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n3 5\n3 6\n1 0 0 0 2 0\n\nExample Output\n5\n2\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: The possible subsets $W$ are $\\{1\\}$, $\\{3\\}$, $\\{1, 3\\}$, $\\{3, 6\\}$ and $\\{1, 3, 6\\}$.\nTest Case 2: The possible subsets $W$ are $\\{3\\}$ and $\\{3, 6\\}$.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin2\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BLREDSET\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-11-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
