b'\nChef Jessie has a lot of recipes with her (N). She often remembered the starting few characters of the recipe and forgot the rest. As all the great chefs do, Jessie also numbered the recipes depending on the priority. So, given the list of recipes along with their priorities answer Jessie\xe2\x80\x99s queries.\nJessie\xe2\x80\x99s queries are as follows:\nShe gives you the first few characters of a recipe; you have to print the complete recipe with the highest priority.\nNote:\nEvery recipe has a unique priority\n\nInput\n\nFirst line contains an integer N - the number of recipes.\nFollowed by N strings Si along with an integer each Vi.Si stands for the recipe and Vi for the priority.\nIt is followed by an integer Q - the number of queries.\nFollowed by Q strings Qi.\nEach string Si, Qi contain only lowercase Latin alphabets (\'a\' - \'z\') and \'-\'.Output\nQ \xe2\x80\x93 lines, each contain the answer for each of the query.\nIf for a query no recipe matches print "NO". (Without quotes)\nConstraints:\n0 <= N <= 1000\n\n0 <= Q <= 1000\n\n-10^9 <= Vi <= 10^9\n\n1 <= |Si| <= 1000 (length of Si)\n\n1 <= |Qi| <= 1000 (length of Qi)\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\nflour-with-eggs 100\nchicken-ham -10\nflour-without-eggs 200\nfish-with-pepper 1100\n6\nf\nflour-with\nflour-with-\nc\nfl\nchik\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nfish-with-pepper\nflour-without-eggs\nflour-with-eggs\nchicken-ham\nflour-without-eggs\nNO\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nkaush_adm\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85subra\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TWSTR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Tries, Brute Force\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1529\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-03-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.408163 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
