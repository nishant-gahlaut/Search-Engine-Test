b"\n\nCountry X has a military zone framed as a grid of size MxN.\nEach point of the grid could be free, occupied by a machine gun or by a protector.\n\n\nA machine gun at point (x, y) could automatically attack other guns at points (x-2, y-2), (x-2, y+2), (x+2, y-2) and (x+2, y+2).\nSo we could not put two guns at points which make them destroy each others,\nunless there is a protector exactly in the middle.\nEg.: We could put two guns at point (x, y) and (x+2, y+2) if and only if there is a protector at point (x+1, y+1).\n\nGiven a map with some points which has been occupied by guns or protectors,\nyour task is to find out the greatest number of guns to add to this map satisfying rules above.\nNote that we can put a machine gun at a free point, but we cannot remove any machine gun and protector, and we cannot add protectors.\n\nInput\nThere are several test cases, each formed as follows:\n\nThe first line contains two positive integer M, N.\nNext M lines, each contains N characters (no spaces) of {'F', 'G', 'P'} (ASCII: #70, #71, #80), the j-th character of the i-th line represents the point (i-1, j-1) on the map: 'F' is a free point, 'G' is occupied by a machine gun and 'P' is occupied by a protector.\n\nThe input is ended with M = N = 0.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output on a line the greatest number of guns which can be added the given map.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M, N \xe2\x89\xa4 700\nIn the given map, any two machine guns do not attack each other.\nThe sum of MxN does not exceed 490000 in one judge file.\n\nExample\nInput:\n3 4\nFPFP\nPFPP\nGFGF\n5 3\nFPF\nFFF\nFGG\nPFP\nFPF\n0 0\n\nOutput:\n3\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nanhdq_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85laycurse\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MACGUN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bipartite Graphs, Hopcroft Karp Algorithm, Kuhn's Algorithm\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos, Flow Networks, Maximum Bipartite Matching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2468\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-07-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.40476 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
