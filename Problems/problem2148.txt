b"\n\nConsider the 2-d plane which is white. You are given n semi-discs on it which are colored black. They are placed on the x - axis at various positions, in such a way that its center is on the x-axis and the entire semi-disc is on or above the x-axis. By center of a semi-disc, we mean the center of the disc of which it is a part. For each semi-disc you know its radius and the coordinate of its center in the x-axis. There may be overlaps or one may be completely inside / outside another semi-disc.\nThere are q queries. In each query you will be given a circle with radius r and center C at coordinates (x, y). It is guaranteed that  y \xe2\x89\xa5 r (meaning that no part of the circle is below the x-axis). You need to find the area within the circle which is black. Meaning, area of the circle which is overlapping with some part of any semi-disc. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer, T, which denotes the number of testcases. The description of each testcase follows.\nThe first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers: n and q, denoting the number of semi-discs and the number of queries respectively.\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains two space-separated integers: xi and ri, denoting that the i-th semi-disc has its center at (xi, 0) and has radius ri.\nThe i-th of the next q lines contains three space-separated integers: xi, yi and ri, denoting that the i-th query circle has its center at (xi, yi) and has radius ri.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query in a testcase, output a single line with the answer.\nYour output will be considered correct if both these are true:\n\nIn each query, the absolute error is less than or equal to 0.02.\nIn a single testcase, the average of absolute error over all queries must be less than 0.01.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n20 \xe2\x89\xa4 q \xe2\x89\xa4 200\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 all x and y coordinates in the input \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 all radii in input \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\nSum of n over all testcases \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\nSum of q over all testcases \xe2\x89\xa4 200\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n4 2\n1 2\n2 3\n4 2\n7 3\n7 2 2\n8 3 3\n\nOutput:\n9.3204778956\n10.2198951180\n\nExplanation\n Note that the example shown above has only two queries (for brief representation) and hence doesn't satisfy the 20 \xe2\x89\xa4 q constraint. However, in the original test data the constraints will be followed.\nThe black semi-discs have been colored with various colors for better understanding.
