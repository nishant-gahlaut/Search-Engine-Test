b"\nJohnny is playing Lights Out, an electronic game consisting of an NxN grid of lights. Initially, each light may be on or off. Pressing a light will toggle it and the lights non-diagonally adjacent to it. \nThe object of the game is to try and get all the lights turned off. It is not always possible, and what's more, Johnny's game is faulty. Pressing some lights has no effect. (They can still be turned on and off if they are next to working lights.)\nHelp Johnny write a program that checks whether a puzzle can be solved or not, given the initial description of the grid and the positions of the faulty lights.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains a number t (about 10), the number of test cases. Each test case has the following form:\nThe first line contains two numbers N and K (2 <= N <= 200, 0 <= K <= N). Each line in the next N lines contains N characters '0' or '1' representing the initial state of the grid. '1' denotes a light that is on and '0' a light that is off.\nEach line in the next K lines contains 2 integers, i and j (1 <= i, j <= N), representing the row and column of a faulty light. Rows are numbered from the top and columns from the left.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print YES if there is a solution, otherwise print NO.\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n\n3 1\n010\n111\n010\n2 2\n\n4 2\n1110\n1110\n1001\n1101\n2 2\n4 3\n\nOutput:\nNO\nYES\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndor_adm\n\n\nTester:\n4\xe2\x98\x85keshav_57\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DORADM01\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dor_adm, hard, may10\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2213\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-04-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.311792 - 0.668681 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
