b'\n\n  The description of this problem is extremely simple. You are given 2\n  non-intersecting circles in 3-dimensional world. Each of the circle is defined\n  by 3 non - collinear points lying on the circle. All you have to return is\n  whether the circles are entangled or not (just like two links of a chain). Two\n  circles are entangled if they cannot be separated from each other without\n  breaking any of the circles.\n  \nInput Format:\n\n  The first line contains a single integer, T, the number of test cases. Each of\n  the T test cases are defined by 2 lines. The first line of each test case\n  contains 9 integers representing the 3 points as (x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2),\n  (x3, y3, z3) which define the first circle. Similarly, the second line for\n  each test case contains 9 integers representing the 3 points which define the\n  second circle.\n  \nOutput Format:\n\n  For every query output "YES" without quotes if the circles are entangled and\n"NO" otherwise (quotes for clarity).\n  \nConstraints:\n\n  1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n-10000 \xe2\x89\xa4 Each Coordinate in the Input \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\n\nSample Input:\n1\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 -1 0\n0 0 0 1 0 -1 1 0 1Sample Output:\nYES\nProblem Setter: Lalit Kundu\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85darkshadows\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CIRCLES\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cdcrft14, darkshadows, geometry, hard\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-01-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
