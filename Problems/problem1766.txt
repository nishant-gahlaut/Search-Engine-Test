b'\nNOOB is in bizarre habit of counting everything. So one day he decided to count number of ways in which he can visit a very popular miraculous city Chefland. Chefland is a rooted tree consisting of n vertices with the root at vertex 1. Vertex 1 is also the only entrance in Chefland and every leaf vertex contains an  exit door. But there is a problem. Some of the vertices are poisonous. If he visits consecutive m poisonous vertices he will eventually die, otherwise he succussfully visits that city. NOOB feels some difficulties solving this problem and needs your in finding number of possible ways? \nInput:\n\nFirst line contains two integers n(number of vertices in chefland ) and m(maximum number of consecutive poisonous cities).\nSecond line contains n integers a1,a2,a3...,aN where each ai is either 1(if vertex is poisonous) otherwise 0.\nNext n\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains edges of the tree in the format of p1,p2 where p1 and p2 are vertices of the tree connected by an edge.\n\nOutput:\n\nprint a single integer - maximum number of ways.\n\nConstraints\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n\n\nSample Input::\n9 2\n1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0\n1 2\n1 3 \n2 4\n4 5\n4 6\n2 7\n3 8\n3 9\n\nSample Output:\n2\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThere are two possible ways when Chef exit from vertex 6 and 7.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nthe_rtu_coders\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FINDWAYS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cbiz2020, depth-first-search, medium, the_rtu_coders, trees\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-11-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
