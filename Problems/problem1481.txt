b"\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nChef likes sequences of integers and in particular, he likes arithmetic progressions.\nThere are two integers N and K. Chef wants to choose a starting positive integer A, create the sequence (A,A+K,A+2\xe2\x8b\x85K,\xe2\x80\xa6,A+(N\xe2\x88\x921)\xe2\x8b\x85K) and compute the product of all elements of this sequence; let's denote this product by X. For example, if N=3 and K=2, then Chef can create the sequence (4,6,8), for which X=192.\nFind the largest integer that divides X regardless of the value of A that Chef chooses. Since the answer can be large, compute it modulo 1,000,000,007 (109+7).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the largest number that always divides X, modulo 1,000,000,007.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41018\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2 2\n3 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n6\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: If Chef chooses A=1, the sequence he creates is (1,3) and then, X is 3, and if he chooses A=2, the sequence is (2,4) and X is 8. We can see that the largest integer that divides them both is 1.\nExample case 2: The product of any 3 consecutive integers is always divisible by 6.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85adarshag\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHFDIV\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sieve of Eratosthenes, Binary Exponentiation, AP, Pigeonhole Principle\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Sequences and Progression, Set Theory, Exponentiation\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2373\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-04-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
