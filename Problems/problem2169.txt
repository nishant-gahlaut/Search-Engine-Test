Their teacher wants to group them. The teacher is a fan of randomness and uses the following :\nLet gg denote the current number of groups. First the teacher makes one group containing the student 11. So, initially g=1g=1. Now, for each student ii from 22 to NN in this order:\n\nWith probability 1/(g+1)1/(g+1), he creates a new group containing only student ii. So, now gg is increased by 11.\nWith probability g/(g+1)g/(g+1), he picks one of the gg groups at random and adds student ii to that group.\n\nFind the expected value of sum of squares of the group sizes. If the answer is P/QP/Q with gcd(P,Q)=1gcd(P,Q)=1, print the value of PQ\xe2\x88\x921PQ\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 998244353998244353. Here Q\xe2\x88\x921Q\xe2\x88\x921 denotes the modular inverse of QQ modulo 998244353998244353.\nInput:\n\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer, NN.\n\nOutput:\nFind the expected value of sum of squares of the group sizes modulo 998244353998244353.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 Points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000\nSubtask #2 (90 Points): original constraints\nSample Input 1:\n2\n\nSample Output 1:\n3\n\nSample Input 2:\n3\n\nSample Output 2:\n665496241\n\nExplanation:\nIn the first example:\n\nWith probability 1/21/2, there are two groups,  {1}{1} and {2}{2}. Sum of squares of sizes is 22.\nWith probability 1/21/2, there is a single group  {1,2}{1,2}. Sum of squares of sizes is 44.\n\nSo, the required expected value is 1/2\xc3\x972+1/2\xc3\x974=31/2\xc3\x972+1/2\xc3\x974=3.\nIn the second example,\n\nWith probability 1/61/6, there are three groups : {1}{1}, {2}{2} and {3}{3}. The sum of squares of sizes here is 33.\nWith probability 1/61/6, there are two groups : {1,3}{1,3} and {2}{2}. The sum of squares of sizes here is 55.\nWith probability 1/61/6, there are two groups : {1}{1} and {2,3}{2,3}. The sum of squares of sizes here is 55.\nWith probability 1/41/4, there are two groups : {1,2}{1,2} and {3}{3}. The sum of squares of sizes here is 55.\nWith probability 1/41/4, there is only one group : {1,2,3}{1,2,3}. The sum of squares of sizes is 99.\n\nThe expected value, therefore is 1/6\xc3\x97(3+5+5)+1/4\xc3\x97(5+9)=1731/6\xc3\x97(3+5+5)+1/4\xc3\x97(5+9)=173.\n3\xe2\x88\x921=3327481183\xe2\x88\x921=332748118 modulo 998244353998244353. So, we print 17\xc3\x9733274811817\xc3\x97332748118 modulo 998244353=665496241998244353=665496241\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85jtnydv25\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EXPGROUP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 expected-value, generating-functions, hard, jtnydv25, ltime92\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-11-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
