Their heights from left to right are A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nA squad consists of one or more consecutive soldiers, i.e. soldiers L through R (inclusive) for some L and R such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N. The strength of a squad is defined in the following way: for each soldier in this squad, find the number of soldiers in the squad with strictly greater heights that are standing to the left of this soldier, and sum up these numbers.\nThe Army Chief decided to write down the strengths of all possible squads, but soon, he realised that it is a heavy task. Therefore, he only wants to know the median of the strengths of all possible squads.\nNote: The median of a sequence is the value that is in the middle when the sequence is sorted. If the length of the sequence is even, there are two values in the middle and the median is the smaller of these values (or either when they are equal).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the median of the strengths of all squads.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4500\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n1\n1\n2\n2 1\n4\n4 3 2 1\n6\n5 4 3 2 6 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: There is only one possible squad and its strength is 0.\nExample case 3: There are 10 possible squads, with strengths (0,0,0,0,1,1,1,3,3,6).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85rishup_nitdgp\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFSQUD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Fenwick Trees, Coordinate Compression, Binary Search on Answer\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Pre processing, Algorithms, Searching, Binary Search\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2788\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-05-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
