b'\nThere is a matrix of size N\xc3\x97MN\xc3\x97M. Two distinct cells of the matrix (x1,y1)(x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are painted with colors 1 and 2 respectively.\nYou have to paint the remaining cells of the matrix such that:\n\nNo two adjacent cells are painted in same color. \nEach color is an integer from 1 to 109 (both inclusive).\nThe number of distinct colors used is minimum (including 1 and 2). \n\nNote: \n\nYou cannot repaint the cells (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).\nTwo cells are adjacent if they share a common edge. Thus, for a cell (x,y) there are 4 adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (x,y+1),(x,y\xe2\x88\x921),(x+1,y), and (x\xe2\x88\x921,y).\n\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of 3 lines.\nThe first line contains two space seperated integers N and M denoting the dimensions of the matrix.\nThe second line contains two integers x1 and y1, denoting the coordinates of cell which is painted 1.\nThe third line contains two integers x2 and y2, denoting the coordinates of cell which is painted 2.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output N lines, each consisting of M space separated integers where jth integer in ith line denotes the color of cell in ith row and jth column of the matrix and must be in [1,109] inclusive.\nIn case of multiple possible answers, output any.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x1,x2\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4y1,y2\xe2\x89\xa4M\n(x1,y1)\xe2\x89\xa0(x2,y2)\nSum of N\xe2\x8b\x85M over all test cases does not exceed 105.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2 2\n1 1\n2 2\n2 3\n1 1\n1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 4\n4 2\n1 2 1\n2 1 2\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1:\n\nThe initially painted cells are (1,1) and (2,2). One possible way is to paint the remaining cells with color 4. This way, no two adjacent cells have the same color.\nNote that, instead of color 4, we can use any other color in the range [1,109] except colors 1 and 2.\nThe number of distinct colors used in this case is 3. It can be shown that the minimum number of distinct colors cannot be less than 3.\nTest Case 2:\n\nThe initially painted cells are (1,1) and (1,2). One possible way is to paint the remaining cells as shown in the figure. This way, no two adjacent cells have the same color.\nThe number of distinct colors used in this case is 2. It can be shown that the minimum number of distinct colors cannot be less than 2.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85kugo\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MINCOLOR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, easy, kugo, start30\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1713\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-03-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
