b'\nA cricket team consists of 11 players and some are good at batting, others are good at bowling and some of them are good at both batting and bowling. The batting coach wants to select exactly K players having maximum possible sum of scores. Given the batting score of each of the 11 players, find the number of ways in which we can select exactly K players such that the sum of their scores is the maximum possible. Two ways are different if there is a player who is selected in one of them is not in the other. See explanation of sample cases for more clarity.\n\nInput\nFirst line contains T, number of test cases ( 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100 ). T cases follow, each having 2 lines. First line of each case contains scores of 11 players ( 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 score \xe2\x89\xa4 100 ) and the second line contains K (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 11)\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the answer in a new line.\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\n3\n2 5 1 2 4 1 6 5 2 2 1\n6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n6\n\n\nExplanation\nCase 1 : Maximum possible sum of scores = 11 + 10 + 9 = 30 and can be achieved only by selecting the last 3 players. Only one possible way.\nCase 2 : Maximum possible sum of scores = 6 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 24 and considering the players as p1 p2 p3 \xe2\x80\xa6 p11 in that order, the ones with maximum possible sum of scores is as follows\n{p1, p2, p4, p5, p7, p8 }\n{p10, p2, p4, p5, p7, p8 }\n{p1, p2, p10, p5, p7, p8 }\n{p9, p2, p4, p5, p7, p8 }\n{p1, p2, p9, p5, p7, p8 }\n{p10, p2, p9, p5, p7, p8 }\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nanil_adm\n\n\nTester:\nMaksflow\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BESTBATS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 anil_adm, cook21, easy\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1228\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-03-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.444444 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
