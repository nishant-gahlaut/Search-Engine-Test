b"\n\nThe country in which Chef Ciel lives has many earthquakes.\nSince Ciel's restaurant is far away from an evacuation center, Ciel is afraid of earthquakes.\nSo, Ciel would like to know the probability that Ciel can reach from Ciel's restaurant to the evacuation center when an earthquake occurs.\nYour task is calculating the probability under the following assumptions.\n\n\nCiel's city has R*C junctions (i, j) for 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 R, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 j \xe2\x89\xa4 C.\nThere is a two-way road between the junctions (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) if and only if |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2| = 1.\nWhen an earthquake occurs, each road is destroyed with probability p, and these events are statistically independent of each other.\nCiel's restaurant is in the junction (1, 1), and the evacuation center is in the junction (R, C).\nCiel only considers a big earthquake, so you can assume that p is not less than 0.1.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.\nThen T test cases follow.\nEach test case has 3 numbers R, C and p, where R and C are integers.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output the required probability.\nYour answer must have an absolute error no more than 0.000001 (10-6).\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 50\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4 8\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 C \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000000000000000 (1018)\n0.1 \xe2\x89\xa4 p \xe2\x89\xa4 1\np has at most four digits after the decimal point.\n\nSample Input\n5\n2 2 0.5\n3 2 0.7\n2 3 0.7\n1 1 0.2\n7 7 0.8\nSample Output\n0.4375\n0.0768204\n0.0768204\n1\n0.000003962379607\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nhiroto_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85anton_lunyov\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CIELQUAK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Number Theory, DP Approach, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3038\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-02-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.88149 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
