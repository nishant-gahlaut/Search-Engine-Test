b"\nChef was recently watching Modi Ji's speech and he had a perfect array of integers with him. A perfect array is one in which sum of odd index elements equals the sum of even index elements.\nAs soon as Modi Ji announced the lockdown, he was shocked and lost one of the elements in the array. So, it is quite possible that the array is no longer perfect.\nHe needs your help. You are given an array of NN integers. You need to add exactly one integer in the beginning of the array so that it becomes perfect.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nFirst line of test case contains an integer NN.\nNext line contains NN space seperated integers, A0A0, A1A1, \xe2\x80\xa6 , An\xe2\x88\x921An\xe2\x88\x921.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line, the integer value to be added at the beginning of the array.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n\xe2\x88\x92105\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4105\xe2\x88\x92105\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSample Input:\n2\n4\n1 2 3 4\n3\n6 1 2\n\nSample Output:\n-2\n7\n\nEXPLANATION:\nIn case 11, after adding \xe2\x88\x922\xe2\x88\x922 at 0th0th index, the array becomes: [\xe2\x88\x922\xe2\x88\x922, 11, 22, 33, 44]. The sum of odd and even index elements are both equal to 44 now.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85sahil_bansal\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EVEODDEQ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 array, easy, mathematics, mpcc2020, sahil_bansal\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-03-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
