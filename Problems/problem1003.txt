b"\n\nChef Ciel likes 8. Ciel's restaurant has many menus whose prices are multiples of 8.\nNow, Ciel has some digits written on a wooden board, and she'd like to cut the board to display prices in a new menu.\nIn how many ways can Ciel choose consecutive digits from the board which denote integer multiples of 8?\n\n\nIn this problem, an integer must not have leading zeros.\nFor example, 0, 8, 48, 1000 are integer multiples of 8, but 00, 5, 58, 01000 are not.\n\nInput\n\nAn input contains a string S, which denotes digits written on the wooden board.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the number of ways in which Ciel can choose consecutive digits which denote integer multiples of 8.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000 (106), where |S| means the length of S.S doesn't contain non-digit charactors.\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5858\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nExplanation\n\nCiel can choose 5, 8, 5, 8, 58, 85, 58, 585, 858 and 5858.\nHere, only 8 and 8 are multiples of 8.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nhiroto_adm\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85shangjingbo\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CIEL8STR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1784\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-11-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.128205 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
