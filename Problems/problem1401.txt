b'\n Chef loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.\n\n Chef also use term "lucky sum". Lucky sum is an operation between two integers. Let the first integer is A, A[i] equals i-th digit of A (0-base numeration, from right to left) and the second integer is B, B[i] equals to i-th digit of B. Then the lucky sum of A and B is equal to C, C[i] = max(A[i], B[i]). If i is greater than or equal to size of integer, the i-th digit is equal to 0. For example, the lucky sum of 47 and 729 equals 749, the lucky sum of 74 and 92 and 477 equals 497.\n\n Chef has an array W of integers. Find a number of non-empty subsequences of W such that the lucky sum of integers in that subsequences is a lucky number.\n\n Subsequence of W is created by erasing some number (probably zero) elements from W.\n\nInput\nFirst line contains one number T, number of test cases. Each test is formed as follows: first line contains integer n - number of integers in W, next line contains n integers - array W for corresponding test.\n\nOutput\nFor each T test cases print one integer - result for the corresponding test.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <= 10\n\n1 <= n <= 50\n\n1 <= Wi < 10^9\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2\n4 7\n3\n43 87 44\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85witaliy_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85laycurse\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LUCKY3\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DP Bitmask, Bitmasking, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Mathematics, Bit Manipulation, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1875\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-11-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.43449 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
