b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nChef likes points located at integer coordinates in a space having N dimensions. In particular, he likes sets of such points having diameter exactly equal to D (called D-sets). The diameter of a set of points is the maximum distance between any pair of points in the set. The distance between two points (a1,a2,...,aN) and (b1,b2,...,bN) is max{|a1-b1|, |a2-b2|, ..., |aN-bN|}.\n\n\nChef would like to know how many D-sets exist. However, he soon realized that, without any extra constraints, there is an infinite number of D-sets. Thus, he would only like to count the number of classes of D-sets, such that any two D-sets which belong to the same class are equivalent under translation. To be more precise, two D-sets X and Y are considered equivalent (and belong to the same class) if:\nthey contain the same number of points AND\nthere exists a tuple of N integer numbers (t1, ..., tN) such that by translating each point of X by the amount ti in dimension i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N) we obtain the set of points Y.\n\n\n\nLet's consider N=2, D=4 and the following sets of points X={(1,2), (5,5), (4,3)} and Y={(2,5), (5,6), (6,8)}. Let's consider now the tuple (1,3). By translating each point of X by the amounts specified by this tuple we obtain the set {(2,5), (6,8), (5,6)}, which is exactly the set Y. Thus, the two sets X and Y are equivalent and belong to the same class.\n\n\nHelp Chef find the number of classes of D-sets modulo 1000000007 (109+7).\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains two space-separated integers describing a test case: N and D.\nOutput\nFor each test case (in the order given in the input), output the number of classes of D-sets modulo 1000000007.\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 D \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000000  (109)\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n5\n1 10\n2 1\n2 10\n3 1\n3 3\n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput:\n512\n9\n498134775\n217\n548890725\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\nWhen N=1 all the points are arranged in a line. In order to have a diameter equal to 10 each D-set must contain two points at distance 10. Between two such points there may be up to 9 points which may belong to the D-set or not. Thus, there are 29=512 classes of D-sets.\n\nExample case 2:\nThere are 9 classes of D-sets. One D-set from each class is given below:\n{(0,0), (0,1)}\n{(0,0), (1,0)}\n{(0,0), (1,1)}\n{(0,1), (1,0)}\n{(0,0), (0,1), (1,0)}\n{(0,0), (0,1), (1,1)}\n{(0,0), (1,0), (1,1)}\n{(0,1), (1,0), (1,1)}\n{(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)}\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85mugurelionut\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CNTDSETS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Euler Theorem, Permutations & Combinations, Inclusion Exclusion Principle\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Set Theory, Combinatorics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2565\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-08-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
