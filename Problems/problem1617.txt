b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nYou are given an N\xc3\x97M matrix where each element of the matrix consists of an integer color. Let A[i][j] be the color on the matrix in the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left. You need to make the matrix beautiful.\nBy definition, a matrix is beautiful if all the elements of the i-th row have color i. \nThat is, all the elements of the first row have color 1, all elements of the second row have color 2, so on.\nIn an operation, you can do the following:\n\nChoose four integers x1,y1,x2,y2 (1\xe2\x89\xa4x1,x2\xe2\x89\xa4N, 1\xe2\x89\xa4y1,y2\xe2\x89\xa4M, x1\xe2\x89\xa0x2,y1\xe2\x89\xa0y2)\nSwap the values A[x1][y1] and A[x2][y1].\nSwap the values A[x1][y2] and A[x2][y2].\n\nIf you can make the matrix beautiful, then give a sequence of at most (N+3)\xe2\x8b\x85(M+3) operations to do so. Otherwise, print \xe2\x88\x921.\nWe have a proof that if it is possible to make the matrix beautiful in a finite number of operations, then it can be done in at most (N+3)\xe2\x8b\x85(M+3) operations.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers N and M.\nThe next N lines have M integers each. The j-th integer in the i-th line denotes A[i][j]\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case:\n\nIf it is possible to make the matrix beautiful:\nPrint the number of operations you perform in a new line. This number has to be less than or equal to (N+3)\xe2\x8b\x85(M+3).\nFor each operation print four integers: x1, y1, x2, y2 in a new line. \nIf it is not possible to make the matrix beautiful:\nPrint \xe2\x88\x921 in a new line.\n\nIf there are multiple ways to make the matrix beautiful with at most (N+3)\xe2\x8b\x85(M+3) operations, you may print any of them.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa450\nEach column contains a permutation of the integers 1,\xe2\x80\xa6,N.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 3\n1 1 1\n2 3 3\n3 2 2\n3 3\n1 1 1\n2 3 2\n3 2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2 2 3 3\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\n\nFor the first test case, we can swap A[2][2],A[3][2] and swap A[2][3],A[3][3] to make the matrix beautiful.\nFor the second test case it is not possible to make the matrix beautiful.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85smarth297\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MATBEAUT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2912\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-07-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
