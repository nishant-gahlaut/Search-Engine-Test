He wants to sort them in a particular order which he finds the most beautiful. You are given a permutation p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pN of the integers 1 through N; for each valid i, Chef wants the i-th vase to end up as the pi-th vase from the left.\nIn order to achieve this, Chef can swap vases. Any two vases can be swapped in 1 minute. Chef also has a very efficient, but limited, robot at his disposal. You are given M pairs (X1,Y1),(X2,Y2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(XM,YM). For each valid i, the robot can instantly swap two vases whenever one of them is at the position Xi and the other at the position Yi. Note that the initial positions of the vases are irrelevant to the robot.\nFormally, Chef, at any moment, may choose to perform one of the following actions, until the vases are sorted in the desired order:\n\nChoose two indices i and j (1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4N) and swap the vases that are currently at the positions i and j. It takes 1 minute to perform this action.\nChoose an integer k (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4M) and order the robot to swap the vases that are currently at the positions Xk and Yk. It takes 0 minutes to perform this action.\n\nChef cannot perform multiple operations at the same time \xe2\x80\x95 if he chooses to perform some operation of the first type, he has to wait for 1 minute before performing any further operations.\nWhat is the minimum number of minutes that Chef needs to sort the vases?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pN.\nM lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Xi and Yi.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of minutes Chef needs to sort the vases.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa418\n0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa418\n1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Xi,Yi\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\nXi\xe2\x89\xa0Yi for each valid i\nN>10 holds in at most one test case\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): M=0\nSubtask #2 (20 points): N\xe2\x89\xa45\nSubtask #3 (60 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3 1\n2 3 1\n2 3\n5 10\n2 4 5 1 3\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n1 5\n2 3\n2 4\n2 5\n3 4\n3 5\n4 5\n4 1\n3 1 4 2\n1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Chef can ask the robot to swap the vases at the positions 2 and 3, and then he can swap the vases at the positions 1 and 2.\nExample case 2: The robot can swap each pair of vases, so the answer is 0.\nExample case 3: Chef can swap the vases at the positions 1 and 4, then ask the robot to swap the vases at the positions 1 and 2, and then swap the vases at the positions 3 and 4, taking a total of two minutes.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\narthurfn\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SORTVS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Directed Graphs, DP Bitmask\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2574\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-03-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
