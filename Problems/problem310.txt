b"\nThere is an array AA with NN elements. Each element of AA has a fixed polarity: either north or south. \nChef is allowed to perform some (possibly zero) operations on the array AA. In one operation, Chef can:\n\nPick some subarray of array AA, such that, the first and last elements of the subarray have different polarities, and, rearrange the elements in this subarray any way he wants. \n\nNote that the polarity of each element remains unchanged after an operation.\nFind the minimum number of operations required to sort the array in non-decreasing order, or state that it is impossible.\nA subarray of AA is obtained by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The TT test cases then follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nThe third line of each test case contains a string of length NN, the iith character of which is either NN or SS, representing that the iith element of AA has north or south polarity, respectively.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, if it impossible to sort the array, output \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921. Otherwise, output a single integer: the minimum number of operations required to sort the array.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\nThe sum of NN across all test cases doesn't exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n6\n5\n1 3 2 3 7\nNNSNS\n2\n2 1\nSS\n3\n1 8 12\nSNS\n3\n3 2 1\nNSN\n5\n1 2 3 5 4\nNSNSN\n5\n1 1 2 2 1\nSNSNN\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n-1\n0\n2\n1\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nLet's represent elements with a polarity of north in redred, and elements with a polarity of south in blueblue. The polarity of each element is also labelled above it.\n\nIn the first test case, we can sort the array in a single operation as follows.\n\nRearrange the subarray [A1,A2,A3][A1,A2,A3]: [1N,3N,2S,3N,7S]\xe2\x86\x92[1N,2S,3N,3N,7S][1N,3N,2S,3N,7S]\xe2\x86\x92[1N,2S,3N,3N,7S].\nIn the second test case, the array [2S,1S][2S,1S] cannot be sorted, since no operations can be performed.\nIn the third test case, the array is already sorted, so the answer is 00.\nIn the fourth test case, we can sort the array in two operations as follows.\n\nRearrange the subarray [A2,A3][A2,A3]: [3N,2S,1N]\xe2\x86\x92[3N,1N,2S][3N,2S,1N]\xe2\x86\x92[3N,1N,2S].\nRearrange the subarray [A1,A2,A3][A1,A2,A3]: [3N,1N,2S]\xe2\x86\x92[1N,2S,3N][3N,1N,2S]\xe2\x86\x92[1N,2S,3N].\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85flamestorm153\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MAGNETSORT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, flamestorm153, ltime105, observation\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1804\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-02-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
