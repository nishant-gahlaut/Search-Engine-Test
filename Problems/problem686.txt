b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has two integers AA and B. He can perform the following operation on A an arbitrary number of times (including zero):\n\nwrite A as a binary number with an arbitrary number of leading zeroes (possibly without any)\nshuffle the binary digits of A in an arbitrary way, obtaining a number s\nreplace A by s+1\n\nChef is wondering about the minimum number of operations he has to perform on A in order to obtain B. Compute this number or determine that it is impossible.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers A and B. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of operations or \xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to obtain B from A.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa41018\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): A,B\xe2\x89\xa427\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2 4\n1 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: One optimal solution is to not shuffle anything, so Chef just adds 1 twice. \nExample case 2: We can obtain 5 from 1 in one operation.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85sanroylozan\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bitwise Operation, Binary, Floyd Warshall's Algorithm, BFS, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Bit Manipulation, Number System, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Shortest Paths, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1747\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-05-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
