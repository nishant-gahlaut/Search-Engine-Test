b'\nThe city of Chefland has a metro network of nn stations where there are metro tunnels between certain pairs of stations. The budget was tight during construction, so the nn stations are connected using only n\xe2\x88\x921 tunnels. Every station is still reachable from every other station.\nBeing initially constructed with such a tight budget, it is no surprise that they have fallen into disrepair over time. Chef, the mayor of Chefland, has secured k dollars for renovating the metro stations. Each metro station is different and the ith station requires ai dollars to renovate. But, if one or more stations directly connected to the ith station are also being renovated, it is possible to share certain resources between the stations and the cost of renovating the ith station drops to bi dollars.\nHelp Chef figure out what is the maximum number of stations he can renovate using k dollars.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains t, the number of test cases. t cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and k.\nThe next line contains n integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an.\nThe next line contains n integers b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn.\nn\xe2\x88\x921 lines follow, each with a pair of integers u and v denoting that the uth and vth stations are connected by a tunnel.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase, output a single line containing the maximum number of stations that can be renovated.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4200\n2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41012\n1\xe2\x89\xa4bi<ai\xe2\x89\xa4108\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n, u\xe2\x89\xa0v\nSum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000.\n\nSample Input:\n3\n2 5\n5 10\n3 3\n1 2\n4 9\n5 10 3 4\n1 5 2 2\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n6 15\n20 20 20 20 20 20\n3 1 2 10 4 3\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n4 5\n5 6\n\nSample Output\n1\n3\n5\n\nExplanation\nCase 1: Renovating only station 1 costs a1=5. Renovating only station 2 costs a2=10. Renovating both 1 and 2 costs b1+b2=3+3=6. Only station 1 can be renovated with 5 dollars.\n\nCase 2: Stations 1, 3 and 4 can be renovated for a total cost of a1+b3+b4=5+2+2=9. Stations 2, 3, 4 can also be renovated with 9 dollars. It is not possible to renovate all 4 stations with 9 dollars or less.\n\nCase 3: Stations 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 can be renovated at a cost of b1+b2+b3+b5+b6=3+1+2+4+3=13. More than 5 stations cannot be renovated with 15 dollars or less.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85meooow\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CLMTRO\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, DP on Trees, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2885\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-02-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
