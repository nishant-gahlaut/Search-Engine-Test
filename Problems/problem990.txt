b"\nYou were strolling outside the restaurant at the end of the universe. On a metaspiral path you stumble upon a weird device which takes a three-digit number as input and processes it. The Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy explains that it processes the input in the following manner: \n\nMultiplies it with 13, followed by 11 and then 7          \nOutputs all the distinct three-digit numbers possible from the digits of the new number (each digit can only be used once)          \n\nYour friend Zaphod is in a playful mood, and does the following with the device-           \n\nGiven a three-digit positive number KK, he feeds it to the device for processing.          \nHe then takes the numbers it gives as output, and send each of them through the device and again collect all the numbers sent out.          \nRepeats the above step NN times.          \n\nTo test your wit, he challenges you to find the number of distinct 3-digit numbers which the device outputs over the NN steps. Can you?\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers K,NK,N.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output a single integer denoting the number of distinct 3-digit numbers which the device outputs over the NN steps.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000 \n5\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41095\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109 \nEach digit of KK is non-zero           \n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n123 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85la_flame_\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ICL1901\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1810\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-03-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
