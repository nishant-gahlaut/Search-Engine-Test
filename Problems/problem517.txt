However, they have certain conditions \xe2\x80\x94 for each valid ii, when the i-th friend arrives at the party and sees that at that point, strictly less than Ai other people (excluding Chef) have joined the party, this friend leaves the party; otherwise, this friend joins the party.\nHelp Chef estimate how successful the party can be \xe2\x80\x94 find the maximum number of his friends who could join the party (for an optimal choice of the order of arrivals).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of Chef's friends who could join the party.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2\n0 0\n6\n3 1 0 0 5 5\n3\n1 2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Chef has two friends. Both of them do not require anyone else to be at the party before they join, so they will both definitely join the party.\nExample case 2: At the beginning, friends 3 and 4 can arrive and join the party, since they do not require anyone else to be at the party before they join. After that, friend 2 can arrive; this friend would see that there are two people at the party and therefore also join. Then, friend 1 will also join, so in the end, there would be 4 people attending the party.\nExample case 3: No one will attend the party because each of Chef's friends will find zero people at the party and leave, regardless of the order in which they arrive.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHFPARTY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cook103, easy, kingofnumbers, sorting\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1223\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-02-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
