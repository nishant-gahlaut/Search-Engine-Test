A rooted directed tree is a directed tree in which there is one vertex (the root, let's denote it by rr) such that it is possible to reach all vertices of the graph from r by moving along the directed edges.\nYou are given a directed tree with N vertices (numbered 1 through N). You may perform the following operation on it any number of times (including zero):\n\nChoose some edge which currently exists in the graph.\nRemove this edge.\nAdd a new edge in such a way that the graph becomes a directed tree again.\n\nWhat is the smallest number of operations which need to be performed in order to make the directed tree rooted?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting that there is a directed edge from u to v in the tree.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest number of operations we need to perform to create a rooted directed tree.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe graph described on the input is a directed tree\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): for each edge, u=1 or v=1 (the graph is a directed star)\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n1 2\n3 2\n3\n1 2\n2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: We can delete the edge from vertex 3 to vertex 2 and insert an edge from 3 to 1. Then, the graph becomes a rooted directed tree with vertex 3 as the root. However, there are many other possible solutions.\nExample case 2: The graph is already a rooted directed tree; the root is vertex 1.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85anton_trygub\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ROOTTREE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Directed Graphs, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1934\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-09-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
