b'\nDr. Phil has put you in charge of his new hospital while he is chilling at the ranch. NN people have booked appointment with the Doctor today numbered from 1 to N such that person X booked appointment before person Y if X<Y. \nNow, the people do not necessarily arrive at the hospital on time, so you decide of an unusual way of handling the situation. At the start you fulfill the appointment of the people who booked first (so if person 1 is available then that person can meet the doctor) otherwise you look for next available person.\nIf you fulfill the appointment of any person and their exist some people (1 or more) who have booked earlier but haven\xe2\x80\x99t arrived at the hospital yet, then those people are said to have missed their appointment.\nIf at some point of time there exists a set of people that have missed their appointment earlier and the person who booked appointment most recently among them (later than others in that set) say person X is now available then X is given the priority to meet the doctor over any other person. But even if any person in that set Y other than X is available and X is not available then you start appointments of the people who have not yet missed their appointments in their order of booking.\nYou are given the order in which people arrive at the hospital and have to print the order of their appointments.\nNote: Use fast input/output methods. Python users should submit their solutions in PYPY 3.\nInput:\n\xe2\x88\x99First line contains T, the number of test cases.\n\xe2\x88\x99First line of each test case contains a single integer N, the number of people who have booked appointment.\n\xe2\x88\x99Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the order of their arrival.\nOutput:\n-For each test case print in a new line N space separated integers denoting the order of their appointment.\nConstraints\n\xe2\x88\x991\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n\xe2\x88\x991\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4104\nSample Input:\n3\n3\n3 1 2\n9\n1 3 2 6 4 7 5 8 9\n5\n4 2 3 5 1\nSample Output:\n3 2 1\n1 3 2 6 7 5 4 8 9\n4 3 2 5 1\nEXPLANATION:\nSampleCase1\n3 arrives earlier than others therefore 3 meets the doctor and 1 & 2 miss their appointments.\nThen 1 arrives but will have to wait for 2 to finish his appointment since they both missed their appointment and 2 was the most recent one among the two to book it.\nSampleCase2\n1 arrives before anyone else and meets the doctor, since no one booked an appointment before 1, no one missed their appointment.\nThen 3 arrives causing 2 to miss the appointment.\nThen 2 arrives and since he is the most recent person to miss an appointment, he meets the doctor. \nThen 6 arrives causing 4 & 5 to miss their appointments.\nThen 7 arrives and since 5 has not yet arrived, gets to meet the doctor.\nThen 5 arrives and since among the people who missed their appointment he is the most recent once, he gets to meet the doctor.\nThen 4 arrives and since he is the most recent one to miss his appointment, gets to meet the doctor.\nThen 8 and 9 arrive in order and meet the doctor in order.\nSampleCase3\n4 arrives earliest causing 1, 2, and 3 to miss their appointments.\n2 arrives but cannot meet the doctor as 3 has not yet arrived.\n3 arrives and meets the doctor then 2 meets the doctor.\n5 arrives and meets the doctor.\n1 arrives and meets the doctor.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85vallabh43\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CAC202\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, queue, stack, vallabh43\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-07-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
