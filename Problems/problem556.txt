b'\nRead problem statements in Mandarin, Bengali, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef and Divyam are playing a game. They start with a rational number X, such that 0<X<1.\nIn each turn, Chef chooses a positive real number Y. Then Divyam either adds or subtracts Y to X. So X is replaced with either X+Y or X\xe2\x88\x92Y. If this number becomes 0 or 1, then Chef wins. Otherwise, the game continues.\nYou are given X, and you have to determine whether Chef can win in a finite number of moves. More formally, does there exist a finite number N so that Chef has a strategy that is guaranteed to win in at most N moves?\nHere, X will be given in the form AB, where A and B are positive integers, A<B and gcd(A,B)=1.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers A and B.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "Yes" if Chef can win the game in a finite number of moves and "No" otherwise (without quotes). You can print "Yes" or "No" in any case.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A<B\xe2\x89\xa41018\ngcd(A,B)=1\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): Original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1 2\n2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYes\nNo\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: Chef will choose Y=12, so whatever Divyam does, the number will become 0 or 1. Hence Chef will win in a finite number of moves. \nTest case 2: No matter what Chef chooses, it can be shown that Divyam can make sure Chef never wins.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85div5252\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/REALBIN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1845\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-05-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
