b'\nA circular array of length N is defined as follows: N integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN are placed in a circle in such a way that for each 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<N, Ai and Ai+1 are adjacent, and A1 and AN are also adjacent.\nYou are given a circular array A of length N. At the end of each second, the following changes are executed in the array: If Ai>0 then the elements which are adjacent to Ai, will get incremented by 1, for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N.\nFor example, consider the array A=[0,0,0,2,0,0,0,5]. \n\nInitially A4 and A8 are greater than zero. So after one second, A3, A5, A1 and A7 will get incremented by 1. Hence the array will become A=[1,0,1,2,1,0,1,5].\nAfter two seconds, the array becomes A=[2,2,2,4,2,2,2,7]. Note that the value of A4 has become 4, because both, A3 and A5 were greater than zero after one second.\n\nWhat will be the sum of elements present in the array A after K seconds?\nInput Format\n\nThe first line will contain T, number of testcases. Then T testcases follow.\nThe first line of each testcase contains 2 space separated integers N and K.\nThe second line of each testcase line contains N integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. \n\nOutput Format\nFor each testcase, output in a single line containing the sum of the all the elements present in the array A after K seconds.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4106\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4109\nSum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n6 1\n0 1 0 1 0 0\n3 0\n0 1 2\n8 2\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 5\n3 10\n1 2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n6\n3\n23\n66\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: After one second, the array will become A=[1,1,2,1,1,0]. So the sum of elements present in the array is = 1+1+2+1+1+0=6.\nTest Case 2: No change will be executed in the array as K=0. So the required sum will be equal to 3.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85soumyadeep_21\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/POSSPEW\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1892\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-07-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
