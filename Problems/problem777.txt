b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nSpring is interesting season of year. Chef is thinking about different things, but last time he thinks about interesting game - "Strange Matrix". \nChef has a matrix that consists of n rows, each contains m elements. Initially, the element aij of matrix equals j. (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 n, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 j \xe2\x89\xa4 m). \nThen p times some element aij is increased by 1. \nThen Chef needs to calculate the following: \nFor each row he tries to move from the last element (with number m) to the first one (with the number 1). \nWhile staying in aij Chef can only move to aij - 1 only if aij - 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 aij. \nThe cost of such a movement is aij - aij - 1.\nOtherwise Chef can\'t move and lose (in this row).\nIf Chef can move from the last element of the row to the first one, then the answer is the total cost of all the movements. \nIf Chef can\'t move from the last element of the row to the first one, then the answer is -1. \n Help Chef to find answers for all the rows after P commands of increasing. \nInput\nThe first line contains three integers n, m and p denoting the number of rows, the number of elements a single row and the number of increasing commands. \nEach of next p lines contains two integers i and j denoting that the element aij  is increased by one. \nOutput\nFor each row in a single line print the answer after the P increasing commands.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n, m, p \xe2\x89\xa4 10 ^ 5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 j \xe2\x89\xa4 m\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4 4 6\n2 2\n3 2 \n3 2 \n4 3\n4 4\n4 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n-1\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nHere is the whole matrix after P commands:\n1 2 3 4\n1 3 3 4\n1 4 3 4\n1 2 5 5\n Explanations to the answer: \nThe first line is without changes: 4-3=1, 3-2=1, 2-1=1. answer = 3. \nThe second line: 4-3=1, 3-3=0, 3-1=2. The answer is 3. \nThe third line: 4-3=1, 3-4=-1, Chef can\'t move to the first number here. Therefore, the answer is -1. \nThe fourth line: 5-5=0, 5-2=3, 2-1=1. The answer is 4. \n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nberezin\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFBM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 2D Arrays, Maps, Hashmaps, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1900\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-03-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 - 2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
