b"\n\nChef Ciel bought a new video game for guests to kill time until their orders arrive.\nIn this game, you are a fighter in a battle arena, and you will fight against a fighter called Shindannin.\nIn Japan, many people believe that the next day will be a happy day if they beat Shindannin, otherwise the next day will be an unhappy day.\n\n\nLet's start by defintions of some variables.\nVA and VB denote your initial HP (health points) and Shindannin's initial HP respectively.\nSA and SB denote your strength and Shindannin's strength respectively.\nMA denotes your initial MP (magical points), which is used when you use a skill. Note that only you can use a skill in the battle.\n\n\nIn each turn, the battle will go on as follows:\n\n\nFirstly, you can use a skill as many times as you like as long as your MP is positive. If you use a skill, your HP and Shindannin's HP are decreased by half and your MP is decreased by 1. If HP becomes a non-integer, HP will be rounded up to the nearest integer. To be more precise, new HP will be ceil(old HP / 2).\nNext, an integer s is chosen in [0, SA] uniformly randomly, and an integer t is chosen in [0, SB] uniformly randomly.\nThen, your HP is decresed by t, and Shindannin's HP is decreased by s simultaneously.\nIf both fighter have positive HP, next turn will occur.\n\n\nWhen a fighter's HP is down to zero or a negative integer, this fighter loses.\nIf both fighters' HP is down to zero or negative integer simultaneously, you will fight against Shindannin again with the same conditions, that is, HP and MP are recovered completely before next battle.\nThere is no limit on the number of rematches.\nIf you fight optimally, what is your winning percentage?\n\nInput\n\nAn input contains 5 integers VA, VB, SA,  SB and MA.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the maximum winning percentage you can achieve.\nThis value must have an absolute error no more than 10-6.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 VA, VB \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 SA, SB \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 MA \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n\nSample Input 1\n5 5 3 3 0\nSample Output 1\n0.5\nSample Input 2\n5 5 3 3 1\nSample Output 2\n0.58886609097948\nSample Input 3\n58 85 8 13 0\nSample Output 3\n0.00011046536069\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nhiroto_adm\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85shangjingbo\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CIELBTL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming, Binary Search on Answer\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Searching, Binary Search\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2569\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-11-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.144428 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
