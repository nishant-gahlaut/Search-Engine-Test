b'\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nFinally, progress reached the Madoka family and she decided to play with her little sister in the sensational game Space Arrays.\nThe rules of the game are as follows:\n\nInitially, a sequence a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aNa1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN is given.\nThe players alternate turns.\nIn each turn, the current player must choose an index ii and increment aiai, i.e. change aiai to ai+1ai+1.\nAfterwards, if there is no permutation p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pNp1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pN of the integers 11 through NN such that ai\xe2\x89\xa4piai\xe2\x89\xa4pi holds for each valid ii, the current player loses.\nOtherwise, the game continues with the next turn.\n\nMadoka is asking you to help her \xe2\x80\x95 tell her if the first player (the player that plays in the first turn) or second player wins this game if both play optimally.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aNa1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "First" if the first player wins or "Second" if the second player wins (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851041\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\nThe sum of NN over all test cases doesn\'t exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid ii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): Original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n4\n1 2 3 3\n4\n1 1 3 3\n5\n1 2 2 1 5\n3\n2 2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFirst\nSecond\nSecond\nSecond\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: \n\nIf the first player increases the fourth element,  the resulting sequence is (1,2,3,4)(1,2,3,4). The second player loses after increasing any of the elements.\nIf the first player increases the second element, the resulting sequence is (1,3,3,3)(1,3,3,3), and he loses because there is no valid permutation. For example if p=(2,1,4,3)p=(2,1,4,3),  the second element of aa is greater than the second element of pp.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85fairy_winx\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SPACEARR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 1D Arrays, Game Theory, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1511\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-02-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
