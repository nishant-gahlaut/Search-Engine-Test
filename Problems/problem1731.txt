b'\nChef and The Martians\nMartians build their houses in triangular shapes. They have a tradition that for every new generation, new row of such triangular houses are built joining the previous generation  houses as in figure ( assume that number of newly built houses exactly follows the triangular pattern). In this pattern, the people of mars develop colonies.\nChef saw an overview  NASA overview photographs of such mars colonies. He was very fascinated at the manner the houses are built and he is interested in finding out the number of triangles that can be seen in such colonies for a given number of generations. Help Chef count the number of triangles in such colonies.\n\n\nNote: The first figure represents a colony having one generation, the second fig represents a colony having two generations and the third one represents a colony having three generations.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of colonies.\nThe Next T lines contain a single integer N denoting the number of generations in each colony.\n\nOutput \nFor each colony output a single line consisting a single integer denoting the number of triangles that can be found in such colony.\nConstraints\n\n1<=T<=105\n1<=N<=103\n\nSubtask\n\nsubtask#1 : T<=10 (10 points)\nsubtask#2 : T<=100 (30 points)\nOrignal Constraints (60 Points)\n\n\nSample:\nInput:\n3\n1\n2\n3\nOutput:\n1\n5\n13\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n1\xe2\x98\x85ankurgoel7373\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ankurgoel7373, cocr2016, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-03-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nC, CPP14, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
