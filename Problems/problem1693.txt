b'\n\xc2\xa0\nProblem description.\nToday Rohan lost his way back to home in the woods . He wants to go back to his home . He is n distance away from his home . He can reach his way back by jumping through the woods .\nHe can make either a 2 distance jump or a 3 distance jump . He will make a 2 distance jump with probability p , else he will make a 3 distance jump . What is the expected time for Rohan to reach his home , if each jump takes 2 sec time .\nPS. He can also cover distance greater than n through his jumps i.e., if he covers distance greater than n or equal to n , in both the cases it is considered as he has reached his home .\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\nFirst line of input is the number of test cases t  .  For each test case ,next line contains 2 integers n  and p . \nOutput\n\nOnly one line per test case, the answer to the question ( rounded off  to exactly two decimal places).\nCONSTRAINTS:\n1<=t<=100 , 1<= n <=100000 , 0 <= p <= 1.\n\n SAMPLE INPUT \n13 0.00\nOUTPUT\n2.00\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85arpitdec5\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BYTES14\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 arpitdec5, bytes2016, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-01-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
