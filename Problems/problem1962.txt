b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nBoth Fedya and Alex love playing games. One of their favorite games is playing with permutations. Description of game is given below.\nInitially, they have a N x N matrix with all cells being white. Before starting the game, Alex colors the matrix in following way. he chooses N pair of integer L[i], R[i] denoting that in the i-th row, columns from L[i] to R[i] (1 - based indexing) are colored black. \n\nThe players play in rounds. In each round, both Alex and Fedor make a move. Alex moves first.\nWhen a player makes a move, he needs to provide a permutation P of integer from 1 to N such that the number of inversions in this permutation is even for Alex (similarly odd for Fedya) and all the cells with the coordinates (i, Pi) in the matrix are black. It is prohibited to try already used permutations.\nIf during a round, both Alex and Fedya fail to find the required permutation, the game ends in a draw. If both Alex and Fedya find the required permutation, the game goes on to the next round. If one of the players fails to find the necessary permutation and the other guy finds a permutation, the game ends and the guy who managed to find the permutation wins.\nThe guys are intelligent enough to find the required permutation each time if it exists i.e. both players play optimally.\nNow they\'re trying some big matrices, but they\'ve became too lazy to play and now just want to know how will the game end on the given matrix. Can you please help them?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the side of the matrix.\nThe following N lines will contain pairs of integers of the form Li Ri, denoting the range of the cells that are black in the corresponding row.\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the problem. Output "Draw" if the game ends with a draw, "Alex" if Alex wins and "Fedor" if Fedya wins.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Li \xe2\x89\xa4 Ri \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n\nSubtask 1 (13 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 7\n\n\n\nSubtask 2 (26 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n\n\n\nSubtask 3 (61 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 15\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n1 2\n1 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFedor\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the first round, Fedya picks the permutation (2, 1) which has odd number of inversions (1) and the cells  (1, 2) and (2, 1) are black. Alex is unable to pick the appropriate permutation, thus, he loses and Fedya wins. So we print "Fedor".\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsergey_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BWGAME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Heaps, Determinant\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Mathematics, Matrices\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2832\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-03-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
