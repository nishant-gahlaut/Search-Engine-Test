Let's denote the cell in the ii-th row and jj-th column (0\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N0\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N, 0\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4M0\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4M) by (i,j)(i,j). The rules of the game are:\n\nAt the beginning, a stone is placed in some cell of the table.\nThe players alternate turns, Alice goes first. \nIn each turn, the current player must move the stone from its current cell (let's denote it by (x,y)(x,y)) to the cell (x\xe2\x88\x921,y)(x\xe2\x88\x921,y) or to the cell (x,y\xe2\x88\x921)(x,y\xe2\x88\x921).\nAs soon as the stone is placed in a cell (x,y)(x,y) with x=0x=0 or y=0y=0, the game ends.\nThe winner of the game is determined by the cell the stone ended up in and the player who moved it there; you are given this information for all possible terminal cells on the input. (Note that the stone never reaches the cell (0,0)(0,0).)\n\nYou should answer QQ queries. In each query, you are given the initial position (x,y)(x,y) of the stone, and you should determine the winner of the game.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single string with length MM. For each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4M1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4M), the ii-th digit of this string is '1' if the player that moves the stone to the cell (0,i)(0,i) loses the game or '0' if this player wins.\nThe second line contains a single string with length NN. For each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the ii-th digit of this string is '1' if the player that moves the stone to the cell (i,0)(i,0) loses the game or '0' if this player wins.\nThe third line contains a single integer QQ denoting the number of queries.\nEach of the following QQ lines contains two space-separated integers xx and yy describing one query.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing a string with length QQ. For each valid ii, the ii-th digit should be '1' if Alice wins the game for query ii or '0' if Bob wins that game.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,Q\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa4M1\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa4M\nthe sum of N+M+QN+M+Q over all test cases does not exceed 106106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): the sum of N+MN+M over all test cases does not exceed 103103\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n101\n01\n6\n1 1\n1 2\n1 3\n2 1\n2 2\n2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n110011\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85melfice\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TABGAME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 2D Arrays, String, Pre processing, Game Theory, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Advanced Algorithms, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2072\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-08-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
