The nodes of the tree are numbered from 1 to N. The tree is rooted at node 1.\n\n\nDr. Zero wanted to create a super amazing experiment. Before starting the experiment, he has laid out few important definitions needed.\n\n\n\nA subtree rooted at node x is defined recursively. It contains node x and the nodes in the subtrees of its children nodes. \nThe strategic cost of a node in the subtree is defined as the distance to the farthest node from it in the whole subtree. \nThe strategic cost of a subtree is defined by the minimum of strategic cost of all the nodes in the subtree.\n\n\n\nIn the experiment, he found strategic cost of subtree of each node in the tree. Sadly, he has misplaced the paper containing those results and now seeks your help.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains one integer T, the number of test cases. \nFor each test case: the first line contains N, the number of nodes. \nIn the next N-1 lines, each line contains 3 integers u,v,w which indicates an edge between node u and v with length w.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output N lines, i-th of those should contain an integer corresponding to the strategic cost of subtree rooted at vertex i.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 50\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10^5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 w \xe2\x89\xa4 10^4\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nAll edges are connected to node number 1\n\nSubtask #2 (20 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n\nSubtask #3 (30 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 2000\n\nSubtask #4 (40 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 20\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n6\n1 2 5\n1 5 6\n2 3 2\n2 4 1\n3 6 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8\n3\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nExplanation\n\nThe cost of the tree rooted at vertex 1 is 8, because the vertex with the minimum strategic cost is 1 and the farthest vertex from it 6 with distance 8.\nThe cost of the tree rooted at vertex 2 is 3, here both vertices 2 and 3 have minimum strategic cost; the farthest vertex from 3 is 4 with distance 3 and the farthest vertex from 2 is 6 with distance 3 as well.\nIn the tree rooted at 3, both 3 and 6 have minimum strategic cost.\nThe rest of the trees are single-node trees because they're rooted at leaves.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nalex77\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/AMAEXPER\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 alex77, april16, jump-pointer, medium, trees\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2540\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-11-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
