Of course, Chefland has the shape of a tree \xe2\x80\x94 there are N servers and N-1 bidirectional channels connecting pairs of servers in such a way that there is exactly one path between each pair of servers.\nThe citizens in Chefland are living online; each citizen lives on exactly one server at any point in time. Don't be surprised, it's a futuristic scenario! Each channel connecting two servers has a value called ping. Each citizen can move to a different server through channels; moving through a channel with ping 2w takes w nanoseconds. Initially, there are ci citizens living on the i-th server (for each 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N).\nRecently, Chef has created an ICO for Chefcoin \xe2\x80\x94 the cryptocurrency of the future in Chefland. Everyone in Chefland should receive exactly 1 Chefcoin. How to organize this process? Chefcoins can only be received on certain servers containing cryptoexchanges. Unfortunately, Chef can only create cryptoexchanges on two servers, since they consume a lot of electric power. The citizens want to receive Chefcoin as fast as possible; therefore, each citizen chooses the closest server with a cryptoexchange and moves to that server. Receiving Chefcoin at a cryptoexchange takes zero time.\nChef wants to minimize the sum of the times each citizen needs to spend moving to receive Chefcoin. The two servers containing cryptoexchanges can be chosen arbitrarily. Compute the minimum total time it takes Chefland's citizens to receive Chefcoin!\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers c1, c2, ..., cN.\nN-1 lines follow. Each of these lines contains three space-separated integers u, v and w denoting a channel with ping 2w nanoseconds connecting servers u and v.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimal sum of times it takes each citizen to receive Chefcoin if the two cryptoexchanges are placed optimally.\nConstraints\n\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 50000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ci \xe2\x89\xa4 50000 for each valid i\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 w \xe2\x89\xa4 50000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 u, v \xe2\x89\xa4 N\nthe channels describe a tree\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of N over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 250000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4\n10 25 15 40\n1 2 1\n2 3 3\n1 4 4\n7\n24786 24640 17641 19735 8667 15790 5948\n3 7 17108\n7 6 4875\n7 1 9317\n1 2 8597\n3 4 28200\n1 5 22026\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n55\n1148402043\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Chef can create cryptoexchanges on servers 2 and 4. Citizens on these servers receive Chefcoins immediately. The total time for Chefland's remaining citizens is the time it takes 15 citizens to move from server 3 to server 2 (3 \xc2\xb7 15 = 45) plus the time it takes 10 citizens to move from server 1 to server 2 (1 \xc2\xb7 10 = 10), so the optimal total time is 55.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85wwwwodddd\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CTREE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cook91, data-structure, depth-first-search, graphs, hard, mgch, trees\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3353\n\n\nDate Added:\n3-02-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
