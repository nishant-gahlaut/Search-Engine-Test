When two people with personal strings T1T1 and T2T2 (possibly identical) become friends in Chefland, their strings are replaced by a new string S=T1+T1+T2+T2S=T1+T1+T2+T2, where ++ denotes string concatenation.\nChef recently became friends with Chefina. However, Chefina\'s personal string was her favourite and she got upset when it was replaced by SS. She wanted her personal string back. Chef does not remember T1T1 and T2T2 now, he only knows SS.\nFind the number of ways in which Chef can retrieve valid strings T1T1 and T2T2 from the given string SS. It is also possible that Chef does not remember SS correctly, in which case there is no way to retrieve T1T1 and T2T2.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string SS.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of ways to retrieve T1T1 and T2T2 from SS.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n4\xe2\x89\xa4|S|\xe2\x89\xa41054\xe2\x89\xa4|S|\xe2\x89\xa4105\n|S||S| is divisible by 22\nSS contains only lowercase English letters\nthe sum of |S||S| over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851062\xe2\x8b\x85106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\nabcd\naaaa\nababcdccdc\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: There is no way to choose T1T1 and T2T2.\nExample case 2: Both T1T1 and T2T2 must be "a".\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85rishup_nitdgp\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFSHIP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, KMP Algorithm\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Advanced Algorithms, String Matching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1894\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-05-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
