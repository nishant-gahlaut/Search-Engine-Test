b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nThere is a country whose road system is a tree, the nodes in the tree represent cities and the edge is the road between them, and each edge is of unit length. For safety, the government should put guards to protect all cities. But the government is in shortage of money. So they might not be able to protect all cites.\nYou're concerned about the country's safety, so you get the information of the guards. And you know that on the i-th day, there are k[i] guards\xc2\xa0on the road system, and j-th guard is on node a[j] and can protect every node whose distance to a[j] is not larger than r[j]. And you want to know how many nodes in the road system is protected by at least one guard.\nInput\nThe first line contains an integer n, denoting the number of the cities.\nThen n-1 lines follows, each line contains 2 integers a and b, denoting there is an edge between city a and b (1-based index).\nThe next line contains an integer Q, denoting the number of the days.\nThen Q lines's description follows, each contains an integer k, denoting the number of guards in that day, and k integer pairs a[i],r[i] denoting the guards's information, for simplicity, no node will have more than 1 guard.\nConstraints\n\n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n, Q \xe2\x89\xa4 50000. \n The total number of guards in the queries \xe2\x89\xa4 500000. \n\n\nOutput\nFor each day, output the answer in one line.\nExample\nInput:\n20\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n4 5\n4 6\n2 7\n4 8\n5 9\n7 10\n2 11\n9 12\n8 13\n1 14\n12 15\n9 16\n7 17\n12 18\n1 19\n6 20\n5\n2 9 3 12 5 \n3 3 3 4 1 11 5 \n3 3 3 10 4 19 2 \n2 3 4 10 2 \n5 5 4 11 2 16 2 18 1 19 2\n\nOutput:\n16\n16\n13\n16\n18\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85wjmzbmr\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85shangjingbo\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BTREE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Persistent Segment Trees, Auxiliary Tree, Lowest Common Ancestor\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Persistent Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos, Algorithms, Graph Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3256\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-08-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
