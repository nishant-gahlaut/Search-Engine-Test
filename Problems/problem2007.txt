b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  , Russian and Vietnamese\nThere are N sets numbered 1 to N, all initially empty.\nYour task is to perform two kinds of queries:\n\n\n0 l r x : add the number x to all the sets numbered from l to r. (Note that a set, by definition, can never contain duplicate elements. So a number is only added to a set if it was not already present.)\n1 q : output the size of the set numbered q.\n\n\nInput\nThe first line contains two space separated integers N and M denoting the number of lists and the number of the queries respectively.\nThe following M lines describe the queries. Each of these lines describes exactly one query in the format specified above.\nOutput\nFor each query of type 1, output the size of the specified set.\nConstraints\n\nSubtask 1 (14 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nSubtask 2 (25 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\nSubtask 3 (61 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 2.5 * 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 l \xe2\x89\xa4 r \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 q, x \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n\nExample\nInput:\n5 5\n0 2 4 4\n0 3 5 5\n0 1 5 5\n1 5\n1 3\n\nOutput:\n1\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nHave a look at the sets during the operations:\n\nInitially, all the sets are empty: {{}, {}, {}, {}, {}}.\nIn the first query we add 4 to sets numbered 2 to 4 to get: {{}, {4}, {4}, {4}, {}}.\nIn the second query we add 5 to the sets numbered 3 to 5 to get: {{}, {4}, {4, 5}, {4, 5}, {5}}.\nIn the third query we add 5 to all the sets to get: {{5}, {4, 5}, {4, 5}, {4, 5}, {5}}.\nThe 5th set is {5}, its size is 1.\nThe 3rd set is {4, 5}, and its size is 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsergey_adm\n\n\nTester:\n2\xe2\x98\x85logic_iu\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MANYLIST\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sets, Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2897\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-08-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
