b"\nThe chef is a fan of candies with chocolate and caramel, and has devoted much of his life\nto finding the perfect ratio of chocolate to caramel.\nHe recently discovered the perfect ratio, but to his dismay,\nnone of his favourite candy shoppes sell candies with exactly that ratio.\nSo the chef crafted a plan to buy several candies, and melt them together into a larger candy\nso that the resulting candy will have the perfect ratio.\nHow many candies will he have to buy?\nThe chef may buy multiple candies of the same type.\n\nInput:\nInput begins with an integer N,\nthe number of different candies available at the various shoppes.\nN lines follow, each containing 2 integers Chocolatei and Carameli indicating the grams of chocolate and caramel,\nrespectively, contained in the (i)th candy.\nFinally, there is a line containing 2 integers desiredChocolate and desiredCaramel, indicating the chef's desired ratio of\nchocolate to caramel.\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output on a single line the minimum number of candies the chef will have to buy.\nIf it is impossible to produce a candy with the desired ratio, output -1 instead.\nExample\nInput 1:\n3\n4 5\n2 4\n4 1\n1 1\n \nOutput 1:\n3\n \nIn this example, the chef purchases one of each candy and combines them to form a candy with 8 grams chocolate and 8 grams caramel.\nInput 2:\n3\n2 3\n4 6\n10 15\n5 8\n \nOutput 2:\n-1\n \nConstraints:\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 15\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Chocolatei \xe2\x89\xa4 500\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Carameli \xe2\x89\xa4 500\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 desiredChocolate \xe2\x89\xa4 500\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 desiredCaramel \xe2\x89\xa4 500\nFor all candies, Chocolatei/Carameli \xe2\x89\xa0 desiredChocolate/desiredCaramel\nNo two candies will be identical.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndavid_adm\n\n\nTester:\nMaksflow\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CANDY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Queues, Graphs, Cycles, BFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-09-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.430818 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
