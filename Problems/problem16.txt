In a turn, a player chooses an empty cell and places their symbol on the cell. The players take alternating turns, where the player with the first turn uses the symbol XX and the other player uses the symbol OO. The game continues until there is a row, column, or diagonal containing three of the same symbol (XX or OO), and the player with that token is declared the winner. Otherwise if every cell of the grid contains a symbol and nobody won, then the game ends and it is considered a draw.\nYou are given a tic-tac-toe board AA after a certain number of moves, consisting of symbols OO, XX, and underscore(__). Underscore signifies an empty cell.\nPrint\n\n11: if the position is reachable, and the game has drawn or one of the players won.\n22: if the position is reachable, and the game will continue for at least one more move.\n33: if the position is not reachable.\n\nNote: \n\nStarting from an empty board, reachable position means that the grid is possible after a finite number of moves in the game where the players may or may not be playing optimally.\nThe answer for each testcase should be with respect to the present position and independent of the results in the further successive moves.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \nEach test case contains 33 lines of input where each line contains a string describing the state of the game in ithith row.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output in a single line 11, 22 or 33 as described in the problem.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4391\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa439\nAij\xe2\x88\x88{X,O,_}Aij\xe2\x88\x88{X,O,_}\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): Original Constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\nXOX\nXXO\nO_O\nXXX\nOOO\n___\nXOX\nOX_\nXO_\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 11: The board is reachable, and although no player can win from this position, still the game continues.\nTest Case 22: There can't be multiple winners in the game.\nTest Case 33: The first player is clearly a winner with one of the diagonals.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TCTCTOE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Graphs, Case work, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Special, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1610\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-04-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
