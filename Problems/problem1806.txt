It's guaranteed that no two bishops share the same position.\nfollowmatrix convention\n\nOutput\nOutput one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of pairs of bishops which attack each other.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 xi , yi \xe2\x89\xa4 103\n\nSub Task\n\nTask 1: 10 points 2<=n<=10,chess board (8 by 8), time 0.1 sec\nTask 2: 10 points 2<=n<=20,chess board (100 by 100) time 1 sec\nTask 3: 10 points 2<=n<=100,chess board (100 by 100) time 1 sec\nTask 4: 20 points 2<=n<=10000,chess board (1000 by 1000) time 2 sec\nTask 5: 30 points 2<=n<=1000000,chess board (1000000 by 1000000) time 5 sec\nTask 6: 20 points 2<=n<=1000000,chess board (1000000 by 1000000) time 1 sec\n\nExample\nInput (case 1):\n5\n1 1\n1 5\n3 3\n5 1\n5 5\n\nOutput (case 1):\n6\n\nInput (case 2):\n3\n1 1\n2 3\n3 5\n\nOutput (case 2):\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nfor case 1:  There are 6 pairs. {(1,1),(3,3)} , {(1,1),(5,5)} , {(3,3),(5,5)} , {(5,1),(3,3)} , {(5,1),(1,5)} , {(3,3),(1,5)} , \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85deathcoder007\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BISHOP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 deathcoder007, hashing, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-02-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.1 - 5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, JS\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
