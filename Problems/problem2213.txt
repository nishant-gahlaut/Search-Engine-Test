b"\nYou are given a tree. If we select 2 distinct nodes uniformly at random, what's the probability that the distance between these 2 nodes is a prime number?\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a number N: the number of nodes in this tree.\nThe following N-1 lines contain pairs a[i] and b[i], which means there is an edge with length 1 between a[i] and b[i].\nOutput Format\nOutput a real number denote the probability we want.\nYou'll get accept if the difference between your answer and standard answer is no more than 10^-6.\nConstraints\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 50,000 \nThe input must be a tree.\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\nExplanation\nWe have C(5, 2) = 10 choices, and these 5 of them have a prime distance:\n1-3, 2-4, 3-5: 2\n1-4, 2-5: 3\nNote that 1 is not a prime number.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nchen_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85white_king\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PRIMEDST\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, FFT\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Mathematics, Transformations\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2508\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-06-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
