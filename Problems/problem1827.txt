b'\nSanta Claus loves to play with numbers since childhood. Santa\xe2\x80\x99s mother has given him an array of numbers and tells him to choose any two number where both has three factors separately. For e.g.: -\nIf the array is [ 5, 6, 25, 4], then factors of 25 are 1, 5, 25, and factors of 4 are 1, 2, 4. So Santa can choose both numbers 25 and 4. Santa asks you to tell him is it possible to choose any two numbers where both the number has three factors separately.\nInput\nFirst line contains n (1 <= n <= 10^4) where n is size of the array.\nSecond line contains n space separated integers ai (1 <= ai <= 10^12) where ai is the i-th element\n (1 <= i <= n).\nPrint \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d (without quotes) if it is possible to choose two number where both has three factors separately\nelse print \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d (without quotes) in single line.\nConstraints\n2 <= n <= 10^4\n1 <= ai <= 10^12\nSample Input\n2\n1 4\nSample Output\nNo\nSample Input\n5\n2 6 25 220 121\nSample Output\nYes  \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85avishake_maji\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SANTAFAV\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 avishake_maji, c-plus-plus, jc22020, medium, number-theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
