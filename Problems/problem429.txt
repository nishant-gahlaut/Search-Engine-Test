b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n\nConsider a very long K-digit number N with digits d0, d1, ..., dK-1 (in decimal notation; d0 is the most significant and dK-1 the least significant digit). This number is so large that we can\'t give it to you on the input explicitly; instead, you are only given its starting digits and a way to construct the remainder of the number.\n\n\nSpecifically, you are given d0 and d1; for each i \xe2\x89\xa5 2, di is the sum of all preceding (more significant) digits, modulo 10 \xe2\x80\x94 more formally, the following formula must hold:\n\n\n\nDetermine if N is a multiple of 3.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers K, d0 and d1.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" (without quotes) if the number N is a multiple of 3 or "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 1012\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 d0 \xe2\x89\xa4 9\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 d1 \xe2\x89\xa4 9\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n5 3 4\n13 8 1\n760399384224 5 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNO\nYES\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The whole number N is 34748, which is not divisible by 3, so the answer is NO.\nExample case 2: The whole number N is 8198624862486, which is divisible by 3, so the answer is YES.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85sidhant007\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MULTHREE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Modular Arithmetic, Basic Maths, ad-hoc, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1925\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-01-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
