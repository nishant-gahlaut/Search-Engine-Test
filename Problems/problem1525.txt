b"\n\nGiven a binary represantation of number N. You are to find how many numbers from 0 to N have even number of ones in their binary represantation.\nThere is also an update operation, update (L,R), which means that all bits of N from Lth to Rth are flipped, i.e. ones to zeroes and vice versa. You have to also find the answer after each of these updates.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input file contains binary represantation of number N. The second line contains number M - the number of update queries. Then M lines follow that describe each update query by two numbers - L and R. Note that the digits of N are numbered from left to right. That is, the leftmost(most significant) bit is numbered 1.\nOutput\nOutput the answer for initial value of N and also after each of the M updates modulo 109+7 in separate lines.\nConstraints\n\n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 L \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4  number of bits in  N \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n all digits of N are either '0' or '1'.\n\nExample\nInput:\n000\n5\n3 3\n2 3\n3 3\n2 3\n1 3\n\nOutput:\n1\n1\n1\n2\n1\n4\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nAfter the final operation, N becomes 7. All numbers in range [0..7] that have even number of ones in their binary representation are: 0, 3, 5 and 6.\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\nAuthor:\nroman_adm\n\n\nTester:\n5\xe2\x98\x85utkarsh_lath\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RRBIGNUM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Lazy Propagation\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Segment Trees\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2737\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-09-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
