b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef is very fascinated by the Longest Increasing Subsequence problem. He continues to find many interesting things about them. Along the way he also learned about Longest Decreasing Subsequence problem.\nOnce again, Chef has come up with another problem involving them:\nGiven three integers A, B and N, output a permutation of [1,2,...,N] such that length of the longest increasing subsequence in the permutation is A and the length of the longest decreasing subsequence is B.\nIn case there are multiple possible answers, any one of them will be accepted.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nEach test case consists of a single line containing three space separated integers N, A and B.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing N space separated integers, denoting the permutation of [1, 2, ..., N]. If no such permutation exists, output -1 instead.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\nThe sum of the Ns over all the test cases in a single test file is \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 A, B \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n6 3 2\n4 3 3\n\nOutput:\n3 5 1 6 2 4\n-1\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. In the array [3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 4], the longest increasing subsequence has length 3 (e.g. [3,5,6]), and the longest decreasing subsequence has length 2 (e.g. [3, 2]). \nExample case 2. You can check that no permutation of [1, 2, 3, 4] has longest increasing subsequence and longest decreasing subsequence of length 3 at the same time.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85kevinsogo\n\n\nTester:\n\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LISLDS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Longest Increasing Subsequence\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, DP on sequences\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-06-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
