b'\nGiven a sequence A of length N and an integer M, such that the elements of A are pairwise distinct.\nFor each k (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4M), find the number of subsequences Ai1,Ai2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Aip of A satisfying the following conditions:\n\nCondition 1: \xe2\x88\x91pj=1Aij=k.\nCondition 2: Let f(l,r)=maxri=lAi. Then, for each j (1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x88\x921), f(ij,ij+1)>max(Aij,Aij+1) holds.\nIf p=1 (subsequence is of length 1), this condition is considered to be true.\n\nFind the number of subsequences satisfying both the conditions for each k (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4M). Since the answer can be huge, print it modulo 998244353.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line contains two integers N and M.\nThe second line contains N integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print M numbers in a new line. The ith number is the answer when k=i, modulo 998244353.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa48\xe2\x8b\x85103\nN\xe2\x89\xa4M\nAll elements in A are pairwise distinct.\nSum of N across all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85103.\nSum of M across all test cases does not exceed 8\xe2\x8b\x85103.\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (10 points): T\xe2\x89\xa410, N\xe2\x89\xa418, M\xe2\x89\xa480\nSubtask 2 (30 points): T\xe2\x89\xa410, N\xe2\x89\xa4100, M\xe2\x89\xa4400\nSubtask 3 (60 points): Original constraints.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5 6\n2 4 3 5 1\n7 15\n6 3 12 4 5 1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 1 2 2 3 1 \n1 1 1 2 3 2 2 3 1 1 2 2 0 0 0 \n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: \n\nk=1: The only subsequence satisfying both the conditions is {1}.  \n\nThe sum of all elements of this subsequence is 1.  \nSince there is only one element in the subsequence, we consider the second condition to be true.\nk=2: The only subsequence satisfying both the conditions is {2}.  \n\nThe sum of all elements of this subsequence is 2.  \nSince there is only one element in the subsequence, we consider the second condition to be true.\nk=3: The subsequences satisfying both the conditions are {3} and {2,1}. For the subsequence {2,1}:\n\nThe sum of all elements of this subsequence is 2+1=3.  \nThere are 2 elements in the subsequence. The indices of these elements in the sequence are 1 and 5 respectively. Here, f(1,5)=max5i=1Ai=5 and max(2,1)=2. Thus, f(1,5)>max(A1,A5).\nk=4: The subsequences satisfying both the conditions are {4} and {3,1}. For the subsequence {3,1}:\n\nThe sum of all elements of this subsequence is 3+1=4.  \nThere are 2 elements in the subsequence. The indices of these elements in the sequence are 3 and 5 respectively. Here, f(3,5)=max5i=3Ai=5 and max(3,1)=3. Thus, f(3,5)>max(A3,A5).\nk=5: The subsequences satisfying both the conditions are {3}, {4,1} and {2,3}. For the subsequence {2,3}:\n\nThe sum of all elements of this subsequence is 2+3=5.  \nThere are 2 elements in the subsequence. The indices of these elements in the sequence are 1 and 3 respectively. Here, f(1,3)=max3i=1Ai=4 and max(2,3)=3. Thus, f(1,3)>max(A1,A3).\nk=6: The only subsequence satisfying both the conditions is {2,3,1}.  \n\nThe sum of all elements of this subsequence is 2+3+1=6.  \nThere are 3 elements in the subsequence. The indices of these elements in the sequence are 1,3 and 5 respectively. Here, f(1,3)=max3i=1Ai=4 and max(2,3)=3. Thus, f(1,3)>max(A1,A3). Similarly, f(3,5)=max5i=3Ai=5 and max(3,1)=3.
