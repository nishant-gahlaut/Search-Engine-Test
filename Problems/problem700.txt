b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian \nRupsa really loves triangles. One day she came across an equilateral triangle having length of each side as an integer N. She started wondering if it was possible to transform the triangle keeping two sides fixed and alter the third side such that it still remains a triangle, but the altered side will have its length as an even integer, and the line drawn from the opposite vertex to the mid-point of the altered side is of integral length.\nSince Rupsa is in a hurry to record a song for Chef as he really loves her songs, you must help her solve the problem as fast as possible.\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nEach test-case contains a single integer N.\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output "YES" if the triangle transformation is possible, otherwise "NO" (quotes for clarity only, do not output).\n\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 5 x 106\nSub tasks\nSubtask #1: 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 104 (10 points)\nSubtask #2: 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 104, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 106 (30 points)\nSubtask #3: Original Constraints (60 points)\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5\n3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\n                    In test case 1, make the length of any one side 6, and it will suffice.\n\n                \n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85abhra73\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ADTRI\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Triangles, Sieve of Eratosthenes, Arithmetic, Primes\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Mathematics, Computational Geometry, Number Theory, Basic Maths, Polygons\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1881\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-08-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
