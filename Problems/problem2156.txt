As the name implies, this world is a plane (with a Cartesian coordinate system with axes xx, yy) divided by an impassable infinite straight wall. The wall is infinitely thin, immovable and all collisions with it are perfectly elastic collisions.\nColonel and Erfan are holding two-dimensional tennis balls (tennis discs). They decided to throw the discs, wondering if they will collide at some point. After being thrown, each disc is moving in the two-dimensional world with a constant velocity. A disc with radius rr collides with the wall if the distance of its centre from the wall is rr. In an elastic collision with the wall, the component of velocity of the disc perpendicular to the wall flips its sign and the disc continues moving with a constant velocity afterwards.\nSince just finding out whether the discs will collide is boring, let's define the maximum overlap between the thrown discs in the following way: Assume that the discs can freely pass through each other without affecting each other's trajectory. At each (not necessarily integer) moment in time after the discs are thrown, calculate the area of their intersection; the maximum overlap is the maximum value of this area. (Clearly, if the discs would never collide or only touch each other, the maximum overlap is zero.) We are asking you to tell Colonel and Erfan the maximum overlap between the discs.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers s1,xs1,x and s1,ys1,y denoting the initial coordinates of the centre of the first disc.\nThe second line contains two space-separated integers v1,xv1,x and v1,yv1,y denoting the xx- and yy-components of the initial velocity of the first disc.\nThe third line contains a single integer r1r1 denoting the radius of the first disc.\nThe following three lines describe the second disc in the same format \xe2\x80\x95 the first of these lines contains two space-separated integers s2,xs2,x and s2,ys2,y, the second line contains two space-separated integers v2,xv2,x and v2,yv2,y, and the third line contains a single integer r2r2.\nThe last two lines describe the wall as a line passing through two points. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers wxwx and wywy denoting the coordinates of a point on the wall.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n|si,x|,|si,y|,|vi,x|,|vi,y|\xe2\x89\xa4104|si,x|,|si,y|,|vi,x|,|vi,y|\xe2\x89\xa4104 for each valid ii\n|wx|,|wy|\xe2\x89\xa4104|wx|,|wy|\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa4104 for each valid ii\nthe velocity of each disc is non-zero\ninitially, the discs do not intersect or touch the wall or each other\ninitially, the discs are located at the same side of the wall\nthe two given points on the wall are distinct\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one real number \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum overlap between the discs.
