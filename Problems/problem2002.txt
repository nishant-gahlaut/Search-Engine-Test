b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef holds all his secret recipes inside his house. For this reason, Chef's house is closed off by walls, thus it is very secure. You can think of the walls as a simple polygon in the 2D plane, and you can consider the thickness of the walls to be negligible, i.e., 0.\nUnfortunately, bad guys plan to steal his recipes. To do so, they plan to send a single agent to parachute in a uniformly-chosen random point in the region  [-107,107] \xc3\x97 [-107,107]. (This point need not be a lattice point.) Once the agent parachutes down that point, he then deploys in his exact location a special weapon called the pulverizer, which is designed to destroy walls. The pulverizer works by firing a laser that rotates 360 degrees clockwise, initially pointing north. This laser beam completely destroys the part of the wall it hits.\nOnce the walls are destroyed, the rest of the bad guys can now attack the house more easily.\nUnfortunately, it's not guaranteed that the pulverizer will be able to destroy every bit of the wall. This is because the laser can only hit (and destroy) the first wall it hits, so if there's another part of the wall behind it, that part cannot be destroyed.\nWe will call the plan successful if all parts of the wall are destroyed. The following image illustrates it more clearly:\n\nIn this example, only the first image demonstrates a successful plan.\nAs head of security of Chef's house, can you determine the probability of a successful plan?\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N. The next N lines describe the wall. More precisely, the ith line contains two integers xi and yi denoting that (xi, yi) is the ith vertex of the polygon. The points are given in clockwise order around the boundary.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single real number denoting the probability of a successful plan by the bad guys. Your answer is considered correct if it is within an absolute error of 10-6.\nConstraints\n\n|xi|, |yi| \xe2\x89\xa4 107\nThe points are given in clockwise order.\nThe polygon is simple and has positive area, though some angles may be 180 degrees.\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1: (30 points)\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 40000\n3 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 12\nThe sum of the Ns in a single test file is \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n\n\nSubtask #2: (70 points)\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 200\n3 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\nThe sum of the Ns in a single test file is \xe2\x89\xa4 520000\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n5\n10000000 -10000000\n-10000000 -10000000\n-10000000 10000000\n10000000 10000000\n0 0\n6\n700000 400000\n300000 0\n700000 -400000\n-700000 -400000\n-300000 0\n-700000 400000\n\n\nOutput:\n0.25\n0.00045\n\nExplanation\nThe second example is depicted by the image above.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85kevinsogo\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85mugurelionut\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ALLPOLY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Polygon Kernel, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Computational Geometry, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2895\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-06-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
