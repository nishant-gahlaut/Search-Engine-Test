b"\n\nChef Shifu and Chef Po are participating in the Greatest Dumpling Fight of 2012.\nOf course, Masterchef Oogway has formed the rules of the fight.\n\n\nThere is a long horizontal rope of infinite length with a center point P.\nInitially both Chef Shifu and Chef Po will stand on the center P of the rope facing each other.\nDon't worry, the rope is thick enough to hold Chef Po and Chef Shifu at the same place and at the same time.\nChef Shifu can jump either A or B units to the left or right in one move.\nChef Po can jump either C or D units to the left or right in one move.\n\n\nMasterchef Oogway wants to place exactly one dumpling on the rope such that\nboth Chef Shifu and Chef Po will be able to reach it independently in one or more moves.\nAlso the dumpling can be placed at most K units away from the center of the rope.\nMasterchef Oogway will let you watch the fight if you can decide the number of possible positions on the rope to place the dumpling. \n\n\n\nInput\n\nFirst line contains T, the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains five positive integers, A B C D K.\n\n\n1<=T<=1000  \n1<=A,B,C,D,K<=10^18 \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output on a newline, the number of possible positions to place the dumpling on the rope. \n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 4 3 6 7\n1 2 4 5 1\n10 12 3 9 16\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n5\n\n\nExplanation\nFor the second case,\nChef Po jumps 2 units to the right and then 1 unit to the left.\nChef Shifu jumps 5 units to the right and then 4 units to the left \nto reach 1 unit right from the center.\nChef Po jumps 2 units to the left and then 1 unit to the right.\nChef Shifu jumps 5 units to the left and then 4 units to the right \nto reach 1 unit left from the center.\nDumpling can also be placed at the center as a chef can reach it in 2 moves.\nThus, there are three different positions at most 1 unit away from the center \nthat are reachable by both the chefs in one or more moves.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nisha_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85laycurse\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DUMPLING\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, GCD, LCM\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1738\n\n\nDate Added:\n3-03-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.199495 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
