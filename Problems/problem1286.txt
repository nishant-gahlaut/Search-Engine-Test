b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef\'s team is going to participate in the legendary math battles. This time the main task of the competition is to calculate number of K-special numbers in the range [L, R] (i.e. L, L + 1, L + 2, ..., R).\n\nA number X is said to be K-special if there exist K or more different digits, such that X is divisible by those digits and those digits are present in the decimal representation of the number. For example, number 48 is both 1 and 2 special, as it is divisible by digits 4 and 8. Note that no positive integer is divisible by number 0.\n\n\nChef asked you to help him with this task. There will be Q questions of forms L, R, K. For each of these questions, you have to tell How many K-special numbers are the range [L, R] ?". \n\nInput\n\nFirst line of the input contains an integer Q that denotes number of questions Chef was asked. \n\n\nIn the next Q lines follow the questions, i-th of the line will denote the i-th question represented by three space separated integer L, R, K respectively. \n\nOutput\n\nFor each question, output an integer in a separate line containing the answer of the question.\n\nConstraints and Subtasks\n\nSubtask 1 : [10 points] \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 3 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4  L  \xe2\x89\xa4  R  \xe2\x89\xa4 106  \n0 \xe2\x89\xa4  K  \xe2\x89\xa4  9  \n \nSubtask 2 : [20 points] \n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 3 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4  L  \xe2\x89\xa4  R  \xe2\x89\xa4 109  \n0 \xe2\x89\xa4  K  \xe2\x89\xa4  9  \n \nSubtask 3 : [70 points]\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 3 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4  L  \xe2\x89\xa4  R  \xe2\x89\xa4 1018  \n0 \xe2\x89\xa4  K  \xe2\x89\xa4  9  \n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n48 48 1\n48 48 2\n5 15 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n11\n\n\nExplanation\n\nExample case 1 and 2. 48 is both 1 and 2 special as explained in the problem statement.
