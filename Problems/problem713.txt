b'\nChef has a new customer and he wants to prepare his order as soon as possible. While preparing, he sees that the mint sauce is finished. He has to run upstairs to get it from other kitchen. Chef is currently on the XthXth stair. He has to climb all the way up to the Yth stair in minimum number of steps. In one step, Chef can do one of the following things: \n\nClimb a single stair. ( i.e go from the Xth stair to the (X+1)th stair. ) \nClimb two stairs only if the final stair falls at a prime number position. ( i.e. go from the Xth stair to the (X+2)th stair, only if (X+2) is a prime number) \n\nHelp Chef reach the Yth stair from the Xth stair in minimum number of steps. \nSee Explanation for more clarity.\nNote: The input files are large. The use of Fast I/O is recommended.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains X and Y denoting the starting stair and ending stair respectively.\n\nOutput Format\n\nOutput a single integer representing minimum number of steps chef can take to reach from Xth to Yth stair.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X<Y\xe2\x89\xa4107\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n2 10\n5 12\n34 43\n57 63\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n6\n5\n6\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: Chef starts from 2nd, goes to 3rd stair, then to 5th stair as 5 or (3+2) is prime number. Now, from 5th stair, Chef goes to 7th stair as 7 or (5+2) is a prime number, then Chef goes to 8th stair, then to 9th stair and finally to 10th stair. This approach takes a total of 6 steps which is the minimum possible number of steps Chef can take to reach the 10th stair starting from the 2nd stair. \nTest case 3: Starting from the 34th stair, Chef moves through the stairs as following. 34 \xe2\x86\x92 35 \xe2\x86\x92 37 \xe2\x86\x92 38 \xe2\x86\x92 39 \xe2\x86\x92 41 \xe2\x86\x92 43.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85shivyyy_21\n\n\nTester:\n5\xe2\x98\x85mexomerf\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFMGX\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sieve of Eratosthenes, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2004\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-09-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
