b'\nThere is Chef and Chef\xe2\x80\x99s Crush who are playing a game of numbers.\nChef\xe2\x80\x99s crush has a number A and Chef has a number B.\nNow, Chef wants Chef\xe2\x80\x99s crush to win the game always, since she is his crush. The game ends when the greatest value of A^B is reached after performing some number of operations (possibly zero), Where ^ is Bitwise XOR.\nBefore performing any operation you have to ensure that both A and B have the same number of bits without any change in the values. It is not guaranteed that A and B should have same number of bits in the input.\nFor example, if A is 2 and B is 15, then the binary representation of both the numbers will have to be 0010 and 1111 respectively, before performing any operation.  \nThe operation is defined as  : \n\nRight circular shift of the bits of only B from MSBB to LSBB i.e. if we consider B1B2B3B4 as binary number, then after one circular right shift, it would be B4B1B2B3\n\nThey both are busy with themselves, can you find the number of operations to end the game?\nInput :\n\nThe first line of input contains T, (number of test cases)  \nThen each of the next T lines contain : two integers A and B respectively.\n\nOutput :\nFor each test case print two space-separated integers, The number of operations to end the game and value of A^B when the game ends.\nConstraints :\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100 \n1\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa41018\n\nSubtasks  :\n\n30 Points: 1\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa4105\n70 Points: Original Constraints\n\nSample Input :\n1\n4 5\n\nSample Output :\n2 7\n\nExplanation  :\nBinary  representation of  4 is 100 and binary  representation  5 is 101.   \n\nAfter operation 1 : B = 110, so A^B = 2 \nAfter operation 2 : B = 011, so A^B = 7 \n\nSo, the value of A^B will be 7. Which is the greatest possible value for A^B and the number of operations are 2.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85imreally_john\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GAMENUM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 chptrs01, easy, imreally_john\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-03-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
