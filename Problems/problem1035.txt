b'\n\nDid you hear about the Nibiru collision ? It is a supposed disastrous encounter between the earth and a large planetary object. Astronomers reject this idea. But why listen to other people\'s beliefs and opinions. We are coders above all, so what better way than to verify it by a small code. The earth and N asteroids are in the 2D plane. Each of them is initially located at some integer coordinates at time = 0 and is moving parallel to one of the X or Y axis with constant velocity of 1 unit per second. \n\n\nDirection of movement is given as \'U\' ( Up = towards positive Y ), \'D\' ( Down = towards negative Y ), \'R\' ( Right = towards positive X ), \'L\' ( Left = towards negative X ). Given the initial position and the direction of movement of the earth and each of the N asteroids, find the earliest time at which the earth collides with one of the asteroids. If there can not be any collisions with the earth, print "SAFE" ( without quotes ). You can ignore the collisions between asteroids ( i.e., they continue to move in same direction even after collisions between them ).Input\n\nFirst line contains T, number of test cases. T cases follow. In each test case, first line contains XE YE DIRE, where (XE,YE) is the initial position of the Earth, DIRE is the direction in which it moves. Second line contains N, the number of\nasteroids. N lines follow, each containing XA YA DIRA, the initial position and the direction of movement of each asteroid. No asteroid is initially located at (XE,YE)\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the earliest time at which the earth can collide with an asteroid (rounded to 1 position after decimal). If there can not be any collisions with the earth, print "SAFE" (without quotes).\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 2012\n-100 \xe2\x89\xa4 XE, YE, XA, YA \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n(XE,YE) != any of (XA,YA)\nDIRE, DIRA is one of \'U\', \'R\', \'D\', \'L\'\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\nExplanation:\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n0 0 R\n2\n1 -2 U\n2 2 D\n1 1 U\n1\n1 0 U\n0 0 R\n1\n3 0 L\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2.0\nSAFE\n1.5\n\n\nExplanation\n\nCase 1 : \nTime 0 - Earth (0,0) Asteroids { (1,-2), (2,2) }\nTime 1 - Earth (1,0) Asteroids { (1,-1), (2,1) }\nTime 2 - Earth (2,0) Asteroids { (1,0 ), (2,0) }\nCase 2 : \nThe only asteroid is just one unit away below the earth and following us always, but it will never collide :)\nCase 3 : \nTime 0 - Earth (0,0) Asteroid (3,0)\nTime 1 - Earth (1,0) Asteroid (2,0)\nTime 1.5 - Earth (1.5,0) Asteroid (1.5,0)Note : There are multiple test sets, and the judge shows the sum of the time taken over all test sets of your submission, if Accepted.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nanil_adm\n\n\nTester:\n2\xe2\x98\x85masked_zorro\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COLLIDE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Cartesian Coordinate System, ad-hoc, Brute Force\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1586\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-01-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.440787 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
