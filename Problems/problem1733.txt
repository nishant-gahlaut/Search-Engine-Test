However instead of practicing the usual operations of addition, subtraction and division taught by the lecturers, she was always playing with parentheses.\n\n\nA parentheses is defined using the following rules:\n\nAn empty string is a parentheses.\nIf X is a parentheses, then (X) is also a parentheses\nIf X and Y are parentheses, then XY is also a parentheses\nEvery parentheses can be created using the previous rules only.\n\n\n\nA parentheses contains k blocks if it can be represented as the concatenation of exactly k non empty parentheses, but can not be represented as the concatenation of more than k non empty parentheses. For example ()(()) contains two blocks (i.e. () and (())) and (()()) contains just one block.\n\n\nEvery time Alice meets with the Mock Turtle they create two arrays of integers a and b both of length N, and play the following game T times: \n\nFirst Alice thinks of two integers L and R, then the Mock Turtle chooses two integers i, j such that L \xe2\x89\xa4 i, j \xe2\x89\xa4 R and builds all the parentheses of length ai that contains bj blocks. Since the Mock Turtle loves building parentheses, she will choose i, j in such a way that number of parentheses of length ai that contains bj blocks are maximized.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains two integers N, T .\nThe following two lines containing N space separated integers representing the elements of array a and b respectively.\nThen follows T lines, each one have two integers L and R representing one game.\nOutput\nFor each game, output a single line containing the answer to the problem, since this number can be very large print it modulo 109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ai, bi \xe2\x89\xa4 2\xc2\xb7105, ai is even\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 L \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n\nExample\nInput:\n5 2\n4 6 2 4 8\n3 3 3 3 3\n2 4\n1 5\nOutput:\n1\n3\n\nExplanation\nIn the first query the Mock Turtle can build only the parentheses ()()()\nIn the second query the three possible parentheses are \n\n()()(())\n()(())()\n(())()()\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85alei\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MCKTUR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Segment Trees, Catalan Numbers\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Mathematics, Combinatorics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2868\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-07-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
