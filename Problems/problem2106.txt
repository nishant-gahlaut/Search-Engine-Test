During his assignments, he found a problem which he couldn't solve. Can you please help him in solving the problem?\n\n\nYou are given an oriented weighted graph G with two chosen nodes s and t. Let's order all distinct cuts between s and t cuts between s and t by weight. You have to find the weight of k-th minimum cut. Two cuts (U1, V1) and (U2, V2) are said to be distinct if the U1 != U2 or V1 != V2. In total, there will be total 2^(n-2) such cuts. \n\nInput\nThere is a single test case.\nFirst line of the input contains three positive integers - N (number nodes of the graph) and M (number of edges)  and k \nSecond line of the input contains two integers - s and t \nNext M lines contain information about edges \nFirst two integers of each of the next M lines denoting nodes connected by edge, third integer denoting weight of this edge c.  \nOutput\nOutput a single integer in a line - weight of k-th minimum cut of graph G\n\nConstraints\n\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 77\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 777\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 k \xe2\x89\xa4 777\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 s, t \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 c \xe2\x89\xa4 106\nIt is guaranteed that K won't exceed number of distinct cuts, i.e. 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 2(n-2)\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1:  N \xe2\x89\xa4 10.
