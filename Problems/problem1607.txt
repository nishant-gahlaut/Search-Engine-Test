b"\nRead problem statements in Mandarin, Bengali, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has failed miserably in several cooking competitions, which makes him think that he's been out of luck recently. Therefore, he decided to build a magic circle using his NN chopsticks (numbered 11 through N), hoping that it would somehow improve his luck.\nThe magic circle consists of N chopsticks placed on an infinite straight line (so it's not actually a circle). The line is drawn on the ground and chopsticks should be stuck vertically into the ground.\nThe chopsticks have lengths x1,x2,\xe2\x8b\xaf,xN. For each valid i, the i-th chopstick can be placed on the line at any integer position yi; then it casts a shadow on the range [yi,yi+xi] on the line. No two chopsticks may be placed at the same position.\nThe positions of the chopsticks should satisfy an additional condition: for each pair of neighbouring chopsticks i and j (such that there are no other chopsticks between them), the distances between these neighbouring chopsticks |yi\xe2\x88\x92yj| must fall in a given range [L,U].\nThe magic power of the circle depends on the total shadowed length S=|\xe2\x8b\x83i[yi,yi+xi]|. While Chef expects the circle to have the maximum effect, he must prepare for the worst-case scenario \xe2\x80\x94 due to his recent bad luck. Please help Chef find both the minimum and the maximum value of S.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, L and U.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers x1,x2,\xe2\x8b\xaf,xN.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers Smin and Smax.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4U\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (5 points):\n\nT\xe2\x89\xa45\nN\xe2\x89\xa43\n\nSubtask #2 (15 points):\n\nT\xe2\x89\xa45\nN\xe2\x89\xa411, and additionally N>5 in at most one test case\n\nSubtask #3 (30 points): N\xe2\x89\xa4200\nSubtask #4 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 2 4\n8 5\n3 1 2\n1 2 3\n5 3 5\n1 9 2 6 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8 12\n3 6\n13 22\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n\nTo minimize S, we may set y1=0 and y2=2.\nTo maximize S, we may set y1=4 and y2=0.\n\nExample case 2:\n\nTo minimize S, we may set y1=2, y2=1 and y3=0.\nTo maximize S, we may set y1=0, y2=1 and y3=3.\n\nExample case 3:\n\nTo minimize S, we may set y1=0, y2=3, y3=12, y4=6 and y5=9.\nTo maximize S, we may set y1=0, y2=20, y3=5, y4=10 and y5=15.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nratingoverflow\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BADLUCK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Priority Queue, Sets, ad-hoc, Sorting, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Queues, Algorithms, Constructive, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2843\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-07-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
