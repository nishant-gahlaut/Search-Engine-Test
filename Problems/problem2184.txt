b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nBearland has N cities, numbered 1 through N.\nFor every i between 1 and N-1 inclusive, there is a road between cities i and i+1.\nThere K extra roads: the i-th of them connects two different cities ai and bi.\nSo, there are N-1+K roads in total.\nAll roads are bidirectional.\nYou can assume that every two cities are connected by at most one road.\nLet f(s, t) denote the distance between cities s and t, i.e. the minimum possible number of roads needed to get from one city to the other.\nYour task is to find the sum of f(s,\xe2\x80\x89t) over all pairs of cities (s,\xe2\x80\x89t) such that s\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89t.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of cities.\n\n\nThe second line contains an integer K denoting the number of extra roads.\nNote the unusual constraint for K (in the constraints section below).\n\nThe i-th of the following K lines contains two different integers ai and bi, denoting cities connected by the i-th road.\nAll N-1+K roads will be distinct.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the sum of f(s, t) over all pairs (s, t) such that s < t.\nFor the given constraints, it can be proved that the answer fits in the 64-bit signed type.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ai, bi \xe2\x89\xa4 N\nai \xe2\x89\xa0bi\nAll N-1+K roads will be distinct.\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (15 points): 2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 40\nSubtask #2 (35 points): The sum of N in all test cases won't exceed 200,000.\nSubtask #3 (15 points): 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 1\nSubtask #4 (35 points): Original constraints.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n4\n2\n1 3\n4 1\n5\n1\n2 5\n20\n3\n1 7\n3 12\n17 19\n1000000\n0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n7\n16\n891\n166666666666500000\n\n\nExplanation\nThe provided example test contains T = 4 test cases.\nThe following drawings show the situation for the first two test cases (extra roads are red):\n\nIn the first test case, there are 4 cities and 2 extra roads 1-3 and 4-1.\nSo we have 5 roads in total: 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, 3-4 (see the left drawing).\nThe sought values are:\n\nf(1, 2) = f(1, 3) = f(1, 4) = f(2, 3) = f(3, 4) = 1\nf(2, 4) = 2\n\nThe answer is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 7.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85errichto\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 errichto, floyd-warshall, hard, ltime46, shortest-path\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3445\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-03-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2.5 - 7 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
