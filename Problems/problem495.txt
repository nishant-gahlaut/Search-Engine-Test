b'\nRead problems statements Hindi ,Bengali , Mandarin chinese , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nIn the magical land of Byteland, there are three kinds of citizens:\n\na Bit - 2ms after a Bit appears, it grows up and becomes a Nibble (i.e. it disappears and a Nibble appears)\na Nibble - 8ms after a Nibble appears, it grows up and becomes a Byte\na Byte - 16ms after a Byte appears, it grows up, splits into two Bits and disappears\n\nChef wants to know the answer to the following question: what would the population of Byteland be immediately before the time Nms if only 1 Bit appeared at time 0ms?\nHelp him and find the population (number of citizens) of each type.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing three space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x94 the number of Bits, Nibbles and Bytes.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,600\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (25 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4140\nSubtask #2 (75 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2\n3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n\n\nExplanation\nImmediately before the time 2ms, there is only one Bit. At 2ms, this Bit grows up, so immediately before 3ms, there is only one Nibble in Byteland.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85shivam_g1470\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BITOBYT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1395\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-09-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
