b'\nYou have a grid with $N$ rows and $M$ columns in which $K$ cells are black and the rest are white.\nLet $(i, j)$ represent the cell in the $i$-th row from the top and the $j$-th column from the left. \nIf you are currently at cell $(i, j)$, you can:\n\nmove one cell down to $(i + 1, j)$\nmove one cell right to $(i, j + 1)$\n\nThe cost of a path is defined as the number of times you move between two cells that have different colours.\nYou are given $Q$ queries. In the $i$-th query, you are initially at $(1, 1)$ and want to reach $(X_i, Y_i)$ with the minimum cost.\nFor each query, before you begin, you can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):\n\nChoose a column and flip the colour of all cells in this column (i.e. change the colour of all the black cells to white and the colour of all the white cells to black in this column)\n\nFor each query, what is the minimum cost of a path from $(1, 1)$ to $(X_i, Y_i)$ after performing this operation any number of times (possibly zero)?\nNote: The operations applied in different queries are independent of each other.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ - the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $N$, $M$, $K$ and $Q$ - the number of rows, the number of columns, the number of black cells and the number of queries respectively.\nThe following $K$ lines each contain two integers $A_i$ and $B_i$ - indicating that the $i$-th black cell is at $(A_i, B_i)$.\nThe following $Q$ lines each contain two integers $X_i$ and $Y_i$ - the destination cell of the $i$-th query.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing $Q$ space separated integers \xe2\x80\x95 the answer for each of the $Q$ queries.\nConstraints\n\n$1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5$\n$1 \\leq N, M, K, Q \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$\n$1 \\leq A_i, X_i \\leq N$\n$1 \\leq B_i, Y_i \\leq M$\n$(A_i, B_i) \\ne (A_j, B_j)$ , $\\forall i \\ne j$\n$(X_i, Y_i) \\ne (X_j, Y_j)$ , $\\forall i \\ne j$\nthe sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $6 \\cdot 10^5$\nthe sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $6 \\cdot 10^5$\nthe sum of $K$ over all test cases does not exceed $6 \\cdot 10^5$\nthe sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $6 \\cdot 10^5$\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n1 1 1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n3 1 2 2\n1 1\n3 1\n2 1\n3 1\n3 4 3 3\n1 2\n2 1\n1 4\n1 4\n3 4\n2 1\n4 3 5 2\n2 1\n2 2\n2 3\n3 2\n4 2\n4 1\n4 2\n6 3 5 2\n2 1\n3 2\n3 3\n5 2\n5 3\n3 3\n6 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n1 2 \n0 0 1 \n2 1 \n1 2 \n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1:\n\nQuery 1: We are already at $(1, 1)$, so the minimum cost is $0$.\n\nTest case 2: \n\nInitial Grid:\n\n\n\nQuery 1: The only sequence of possible moves is $(1, 1) \\xrightarrow[\\text{black to white}]{\\text{cost = } 1} (2, 1)$.
