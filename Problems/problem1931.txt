b'\nOnce upon a time, there was a Kingdom of Seven Roads. Besides a fancy name, it actually had exactly 7 straight roads. Its residents wanted to keep track of the distances they traveled so they placed milestones along some roads. The roads slowly deteriorated and disappeared but some milestones remained. Archeologists documented remaining milestones and want to reconstruct the kingdom, starting with its main road. Help them by finding the maximum number of collinear milestones.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. The first line of each testcase contains the number of documented milestones N. Following lines give the coordinates (Xi, Yi) of those milestones. Coordinates of all milestones will be different.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the maximum number of collinear milestones. \n\nConstraints\nT <= 30\n1 <= N <= 10 000\n-15 000 <= Xi, Yi <= 15 000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n5\n0 0\n1 0\n2 0\n1 1\n3 1\n\n2\n1 1\n10 10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ntomaz_adm\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85subra\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MSTONES\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Randomized Algorithms, Computational Geometry, Pigeonhole Principle\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Mathematics, Set Theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2078\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-12-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.858065 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
