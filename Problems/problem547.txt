b'\nChef is given a contract to build towers in Chefland which are made by stacking blocks one above the other. Initially, there is only $1$ block in the inventory and no tower has been built. Chef follows the following $2$ steps in each operation:\n\nEither build a new tower or update an existing tower that has been built in previous operations using any number of blocks currently present in the inventory. After this step, the size of the inventory reduces by the number of blocks used.\nSuppose the tower Chef updated or built has $B$ blocks after the step, Chef gets to add $B$ new blocks to the inventory as a reward.\n\nFind the maximum number of towers of height $X$ that Chef can build in $M$ operations.\nNote: Tower of height $X$ means that the tower consists of $X$ blocks placed one above the other.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case contains a single line of input, two space separated integers $X, M$.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output a single integer, the maximum number of towers that Chef can build.\nConstraints\n\n$1 \\leq T \\leq 100$\n$1 \\leq X \\leq 10^9$\n$0 \\leq M \\leq 10^{17}$\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n2 1\n2 2\n2 3\n53 7\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Cases $1$, $2$ and $3$:\n\nOperation $1$: \nRemove $1$ block from the inventory and build a new tower of height $1$ after which the inventory becomes empty. \nAdd $1$ block to the inventory after which the inventory has only $1$ block.\nOperation $2$: \nRemove $1$ block from the inventory and update the tower of height $1$ to $1 + 1 = 2$ after which the inventory becomes empty.\nAdd $2$ blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has only $2$ blocks.\nOperation $3$:\nRemove $2$ blocks from the inventory and build a new tower of height $2$ after which the inventory becomes empty.\nAdd $2$ blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has only $2$ blocks.\n\nSo after operation $1$, there is no tower of height $2$ built, after operation $2$, there is a single tower of height $2$ built and after operation $3$, $2$ towers of height $2$ are built.\nTest Case $4$:\n\nOperation $1$: \nRemove $1$ block from the inventory and build a new tower of height $1$ after which the inventory becomes empty. \nAdd $1$ block to the inventory after which the inventory has only $1$ block.\nOperation $2$: \nRemove $1$ block from the inventory and update the tower of height $1$ to $1 + 1 = 2$ after which the inventory becomes empty.\nAdd $2$ blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has only $2$ blocks.\nOperation $3$: \nRemove $2$ blocks from the inventory and update the tower of height $2$ to $2 + 2 = 4$ after which the inventory becomes empty.\nAdd $4$ blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has only $4$ blocks.\nOperation $4$: \nRemove $4$ blocks from the inventory and update the tower of height $4$ to $4 + 4 = 8$ after which the inventory becomes empty.\nAdd $8$ blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has only $8$ blocks.\nOperation $5$: \nRemove $8$ blocks from the inventory and update the tower of height $8$ to $8 + 8 = 16$ after which the inventory becomes empty.\nAdd $16$ blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has only $16$ blocks.\nOperation $6$: \nRemove $16$ blocks from the inventory and update the tower of height $16$ to $16 + 16 = 32$ after which the inventory becomes empty.\nAdd $32$ blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has only $32$ blocks.\nOperation $7$: \nRemove $21$ blocks from the inventory and update the tower of height $32$ to $32 + 21 = 53$ after which the inventory has $32 - 21 = 11$ blocks remaining.\nAdd $53$ blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has $53 + 11 = 64$ blocks in total.\n\nSo after $7^{th}$ operation we are able to achieve one tower of height $53$.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85prakhar_87\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TOWERTOP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, prakhar_87, start25\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1693\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-01-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
