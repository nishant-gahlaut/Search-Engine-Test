Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains a single line of input, which has four integers x1,y1,x2,y2x1,y1,x2,y2. \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line, the answer. That is, the minimum cost in pounds to travel from (x1,y1)(x1,y1) to (x2,y2)(x2,y2).\nConstraints\n\nT\xe2\x89\xa41000T\xe2\x89\xa41000 \n\nThe co-ordinates (x1,y1)(x1,y1) and (x2,y2)(x2,y2) of the villages satisfy\n\n\xe2\x88\x921015<x1,x2<1015\xe2\x88\x921015<x1,x2<1015 and\n0<y1,y2<10150<y1,y2<1015\n\nSubtasks\n\n10 points : \xe2\x88\x9210<x1,x2<10\xe2\x88\x9210<x1,x2<10 and 0<y1,y2<100<y1,y2<10 \n10 points : original constraints, but the villages are selected so that the minimum cost for each testcase is <6<6\n30 points: \xe2\x88\x92106<x1,x2<106\xe2\x88\x92106<x1,x2<106 and 0<y1,y2<1060<y1,y2<106\n50 points: original constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n7 5 7 5\n1 1 -1 1\n3 7 5 9\n113 167 361765 170831\n24844359 74532371 14673633991 3057007029\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n6\n78\n278031\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the first test case, the start and end village co-ordinates are both (7,5)(7,5), so the cost is 0.\nIn the second test case:\nFrom (1,1)(1,1) go West to (\xe2\x88\x921,1)(\xe2\x88\x921,1) in one step.
