b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nSigma and Fibonacci were two geeky friends. As ACM ICPC is near, they have started forming teams. Sigma loved summing series and Fibonacci loved playing with fibonacci numbers. They made Gopu as their ACM ICPC Coach. To train them up, Gopu gave them a challenge which will require both of their coordination to solve it. The challenge given by Gopu is described below:\nGopu gave them two numbers M and N and asked them to solve :  ( \xe2\x88\x91 ( 6 * x * y * z * Fibo[x] * Fibo[y] * Fibo[z] ) ) % M , where x + y + z = N.Here x, y, z \xe2\x89\xa5 0 and are integers.\nFibo is the Fibonacci number define as follows. \n\nFibo[0] = 0\nFibo[1] = 1\nFibo[i] = Fibo[i-1] + Fibo[i-2] \xe2\x88\x80  i \xe2\x89\xa5 2 . \n\n Now Gopu is wondering whether he will be able to determine whether they have calculated the solution of the problem correctly or not ! Help Gopu to find the correct answers , so that he can judge the solution for the team.\nInputFirst line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case begins in a new line, containing two space separated numbers representing M and N respectively.\nOutput\n For each test case, output answer as stated above in a new line. \nConstraints\n\nSum of M over all test cases will be \xe2\x89\xa4 106.\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4  1018\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4  105\n\nExample\nInput:\n4100 3100 4100 9100 10\nOutput:\n6366660\n\nExplanation for first test case:\n In the first case, we have the following 10 terms for N = 3:6 * 0*0*3*Fibo[0] * Fibo[0] * Fibo[3]6 * 0*1*2*Fibo[0] * Fibo[1] * Fibo[2]6 * 0*2*1*Fibo[0] * Fibo[2] * Fibo[1]6 * 0*3*0*Fibo[0] * Fibo[3] * Fibo[0]6 * 1*0*2*Fibo[1] * Fibo[0] * Fibo[2]6 * 1*1*1*Fibo[1] * Fibo[1] * Fibo[1]6 * 1*2*0*Fibo[1] * Fibo[2] * Fibo[0]6 * 2*0*1*Fibo[2] * Fibo[0] * Fibo[1]6 * 2*1*0*Fibo[2] * Fibo[1] * Fibo[0]6 * 3*0*0*Fibo[3] * Fibo[0] * Fibo[0]Here 6*1*1*1* Fibo[1] * Fibo[1] * Fibo[1] = 6 is only the non-zero term, the answer is 6.\n \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85devuy11\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SIGFIB\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2868\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-04-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n6 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
