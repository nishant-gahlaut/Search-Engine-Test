b'\nChef has been exploring prime numbers lately, and has recently made a conjecture resembling\none of Goldbach\'s conjectures.\nChef\'s conjecture is that any odd number greater than 61 can be expressed as the sum of\na prime, a square of a prime, and a cube of a prime.\nHe wants you to help verify his conjecture for small numbers.\nNote: negative numbers are never considered to be prime, nor are 0 and 1.\nInput\nInput will consist of a series of odd numbers greater than 61 and less than 106, \none per line, terminated by the number 0 on a line by itself.\nThere will be at most 1000 lines.\nOutput\nFor each odd number in the input, print 3 primes P1, P2, P3 on a line,\nwhere P1 + P22 + P33 is equal to the number from the input.\nIf no such primes exist, print "0 0 0" instead (quotes for clarity).\nIf there are multiple triplets of primes that satisfy the equation, print any such triplet.\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n81\n85\n155\n0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5 7 3\n73 2 2\n5 5 5\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndavid_adm\n\n\nTester:\nfriggstad\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PRIMES2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sieve of Eratosthenes, ad-hoc, Brute Force, Primes\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1619\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-04-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.261261 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
