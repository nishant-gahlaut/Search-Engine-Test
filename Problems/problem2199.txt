b"\n Welcome to the animal kingdom. We have a friend namely Quirk, a spider. He is fond of building spiral webs in anticlockwise direction throughout the diverse sphere. But he faces a lot of problem to select points in the surroundings. Since the web is 2D, we can consider the points to have 2D points. Help him by specifying the sequence of points to start and end the net. There may arise some ambiguity for choosing the starting point of the web. So for resolution, you need to choose the starting point as the topmost point among the set. Note, the threads don't intersect at any point.\n \nInput\n First line denotes 'T' number of test cases\nIt will be followed by 2 * 'T' lines containing 'n' number of points and followed by 'n' pairs of integers 'x' and 'y' representing point in 2D plane\nOutput\n Print 'T' lines each with all the points in the respective input (each integer delimited by a space) in a sequence representing the threads of web\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4  100 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4  50 \n-50 \xe2\x89\xa4 x, y \xe2\x89\xa4  +50 \n\n \nExample\nInput:\n2\n1\n0 0\n6\n6 3 -8 2 -4 3 -4 -5 -1 7 6 -5 \n\nOutput:\n0 0\n-1 7 -8 2 -4 -5 6 -5 6 3 -4 3\n\n \nExplanation\nTestcase 1The input starts from the count of points. The points are pair of integers. Here we have only one point available for making the web. So, the final answer is the only point.\nTestcase 2The input starts from the count of points = 6. The points are pair of integers. Here we have set of points from which we have to make a web including all the points in anti-clockwise direction. So, the final answer is sequence of the given points, starting from the topmost point in the place, moving in anti-clockwise direction, that are connected using threads to complete the web.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85shubham_003\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COTH003\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 convex-hull, coth2017, hard, shubham_003\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-04-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 - 3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
