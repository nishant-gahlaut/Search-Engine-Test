The bast way to do this is to calculate the factorial of a big number. But now he is stuck with a problem. As the numbers increases it takes a good ammount of time to The_Pathogen to solve it. But he want to solve it ASAP he dosent care what kind of machine he uses. Now he wants you to code a program to calculate the factorial of a given number N\nConstrains\n1<=TestCase<=10\n0<=N<=1000\nInput\nFirst line of program will contain number of test case\nEach test case contain one space separated Integer N\nOutput\nFor each test case output the factorial of N\nSample Input\n3\n1\n0\n10\nSample Output\n1\n1\n3628800\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n1\xe2\x98\x85thvardhan\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FACT1K\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 factorial, medium, thvardhan\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-09-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
