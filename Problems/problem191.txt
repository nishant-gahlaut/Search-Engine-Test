b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are NN caves in a row, numbered 11 through NN. For each valid ii, the radiation power in the ii-th cave is CiCi. Originally, the radiation level in each cave was 00. Then, for each valid ii, the radiation power in cave ii increased the radiation levels in the caves i\xe2\x88\x92Ci,\xe2\x80\xa6,i+Cii\xe2\x88\x92Ci,\xe2\x80\xa6,i+Ci inclusive (if they exist) by 11, so all the caves are radioactive now.\nRadiation is not the only problem, though. There are also NN zombies with health levels H1,H2,\xe2\x80\xa6,HNH1,H2,\xe2\x80\xa6,HN. You want to kill all of them by getting them to the caves in such a way that there is exactly one zombie in each cave. A zombie dies in a cave if and only if the radiation level in that cave is equal to the health level of the zombie. Is it possible to kill all the zombies?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers C1,C2,\xe2\x80\xa6,CNC1,C2,\xe2\x80\xa6,CN.\nThe third line contains NN space-separated integers H1,H2,\xe2\x80\xa6,HNH1,H2,\xe2\x80\xa6,HN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to kill all the zombies or "NO" if it is impossible (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ci,Hi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Ci,Hi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n5 4 3 4 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNO\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\nIn both example test cases, the final radiation levels in the caves are (5,5,4,4,3)(5,5,4,4,3). For example, the radiation power in cave 11 increased the radiation levels in caves 11 and 22 (there is no cave 00) by 11, and the radiation power in cave 44 increased the radiation levels in all caves by 11.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85sayantan_das24\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ZOMCAV\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Difference Arrays, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1661\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-07-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
