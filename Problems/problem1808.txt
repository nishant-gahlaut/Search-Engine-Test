b'\nOmar is attending an algorithms course and today they had a lecture about graphs. He wants to practice on some graph problems and he come across a description of a graph \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an undirected weighted graph on nn vertices. It is a complete graph: each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The weight of each edge is either 0 or 1; exactly m edges have weight 1, and all others have weight 0\xe2\x80\x9d.\nOmar decides to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph. (The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of all its edges.) Can you help Omar find the answer?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105,0\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4min(n(n\xe2\x88\x921)2,105), the number of vertices and the number of edges of weight 1 in the graph.\nThe i-th of the next m lines contains two integers ai and bi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa4n,ai\xe2\x89\xa0bi), the endpoints of the i-th edge of weight 1.\nIt is guaranteed that no edge appears twice in the input.\n\nOutput\nOutput a single integer, the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph.\nSample Inputs\n6 11 \n1 3 \n1 4 \n1 5 \n1 6 \n2 3 \n2 4 \n2 5 \n2 6 \n3 4 \n3 5 \n3 6 \n\n3 0 \n\nSample Outputs\n2 \n\n0 \n\nNote\n\nThe graph from the first sample is shown below. Dashed edges have weight 0, other edges have weight 1. One of the minimum spanning trees is highlighted in orange and has total weight 2.\n\n\n\nIn the second sample, all edges have weight 0 so any spanning tree has total weight 0.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsqu_test\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/HW3H\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 chw32020, graphs, medium, minimum-spanning-tree, squ_test\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-05-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
