b"\nCAB SERVICE \nMr. GOGO(Crime Master Gogo) is a very smart person. He uses cab\nservice to go wherever he wants to go. He always directs the cab driver\nhimself to minimize the fare as he has a shortage of money. He has N different\nfriends at N distinct stations connected through different paths. He wishes to\nmeet his friends. What is the maximum fare he has to pay to go from any one friend\xe2\x80\x99s\nstation to another friend\xe2\x80\x99s station while travelling through the shortest path possible\nbetween them?\nCoincider the cab fare to be Rs. 5/- per kilometer and ignore all base and time\ndependent fares.\nInput Format: \nFirst line of input contains an integer T, the number of test cases.\nFor each test case: \nThe first line will contain an integer N,number of Friends or Stations.\n(Each friends location_id varies from 0 till N-1)\nThe second line will contain an integer P denoting number of paths possible\nNext P lines will contain 3 spaced integers denoting- \nstarting_friend_location_id, ending_friend_location_id and distance between \nthem in kilometers(Di,j)\nOutput Format: \nFor each test case the output contains an integer k.\nwhere  k is the maximum fare possible between any two friend's stations.\nConstraints: \nT <= 20\n1 <= N <= 500 \n1 <= P <= 105\n0 <= sfli,efli <= N-1\nDi,j <= 105\nExamples: \nInput\n2\n3\n3\n0 1 5\n1 2 1\n2 0 2\n4\n5\n0 1 1\n1 2 2\n2 3 3\n3 0 4\n0 2 5\n\nOutput\n15\n25\nExplanation:\nIn the first test case\n \n15/- (i.e. 3km) is the maximum fare for going from station 0 to 1 via 2 (shortest path).\n\nIn the second test case \n25/- (i.e. 5km) is the maximum fare for going from station 1 to 3 via 2 (shortest path).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n1\xe2\x98\x85akshatjain2209\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CDIT02\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 akshatjain2209, cdit2016, floyd-warshall, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-03-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
