b"\nTeddy and Tracy like to play a game based on strings. The game is as follows. Initially, Tracy writes a long random string on a whiteboard. Then, each player starting with Teddy makes turn alternately. Each turn, the player must erase a contiguous substring that exists in the dictionary. The dictionary consists of N words.\nOf course, the player that can't erase any substring in his turn loses the game, and the other player is declared the winner.\nNote that after a substring R is erased, the remaining substring becomes separated, i.e. they cannot erase a word that occurs partially to the left of R and partially to the right of R.\n\nDetermine the winner of the game, assuming that both players play optimally.\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each testcase contains a string S, the string Tracy writes on the whiteboard. The next line contains a single integer N. N lines follow. The i-th line contains a single string wi, the i-th word in the dictionary.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the name of the winner of the game.\nConstraints\n1 <= T <= 5\n1 <= N <= 30\n1 <= |S| <= 30\n1 <= |wi| <= 30\nS and wi contain only characters 'a'-'z'\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\ncodechef\n2\ncode\nchef\nfoo\n1\nbar\nmississippi\n4\nssissi\nmippi\nmi\nppi\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nTracy\nTracy\nTeddy\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n1\xe2\x98\x85ashar_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85pieguy\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ASTRGAME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, Dynamic Programming, Game Theory\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1839\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-10-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.188482 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
