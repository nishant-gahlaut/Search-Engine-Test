b"\n \nFor the first problem of the day, let's crack the password of a hacker's computer. If that is looking too abrupt, it should come to your notice that the hacker is a maths freak. And he has provided a number N in the password hint. From intelligence agencies, it is highly advised to use the password as SUM OF ALL FACTORS OF THE NUMBER N. Since the number can be big, the agency is asking you to create a program to do the same.\n \nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains an integer N as described above.\n\n \nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing sum of all factors of the number N. Ensure that each answer is printed in a seperate line.\n \nConstraints\nFor 40 points:\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 500\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\n\nFor 60 points:\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n\n \nExample\nInput:\n3\n1\n2\n4\nOutput:\n1\n3\n7\n\n \nExplanation\nExample case 1. For n=1, Factors are: 1. So sum = 1\nExample case 2. For n=2, Factors are: 1,2. So sum = 3\nExample case 3. For n=4, Factors are: 1,2,4. So sum = 7\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85rounaqwl66\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, factorization, proc1601, rounaqwl66\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-07-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
