b'\nIn order to protect the southern border of Bytelandian Empire against intrusions by various nomadic groups, the Emperor of Byteland has decided to build a wall along the southern border. The best architect Johny is recruited for the task.\nIn order to minimise the cost of raw material, Johny is restricted to use only following two kinds of building blocks:X \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0  #\nXX\nThe height of the wall is fixed and is 2 units, but the length of the wall varies. As a part of his job Johny needs to find out the number of ways he can construct the wall using above two types of building blocks where the length of the wall is specified. Write a program to help Johny.\nInput Format:\nThe first line contains the number of test cases T followed by T lines. Each of the next lines contains an integer N representing the length of the wall.\nOutput Format:\nPrint T lines one for each test case, containing an integer that represents the number of ways of constructing the wall, modulo 1000000007.\n\nConstraints:\n1<=T<=1000\n1<=N<=10^9\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n7\n2\n13\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n655\n5\n272767\n\n\nExplanation\nExplanation of 2nd Test Case\nN=2\nThe wall can be constructed in following 5 ways:\n\n##\n##\n\nX#\nXX\n\n#X\nXX\n\nXX\nX#\n\nXX\n#X\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsnigdha_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85pieguy\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BWALL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Geometry, Matrix Exponentiation, Recurrence Relation, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Matrices, Matrix Multiplication, Algorithms, Recursion\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1796\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-03-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.3504 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nJAVA, C, CPP14, PYP3, CS2, PAS fpc, NODEJS, GO, PAS gpc, D\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
