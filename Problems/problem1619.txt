Can you buzz me in?" \nAnt Man has to help every Avenger in traveling back to the past and fix some major mishaps done by Thanos. He needs to find certain special numbers to form a perfect configuration of the quantum realm.   \nCaptain America, who can obviously do this all day, agrees to help.     \nLets define a special number as a number made of combination of strictly increasing and decreasing sequences of digits (1<=digits<=9).\nE.g. 1, 19, 9523, 1234, 12539752 ( {1, 2, 5}, {5, 3}, {3, 9}, {9, 7, 5 2}) are special numbers.\nThe number 15534 ({1, 5, 5}, {5, 3, 4}) is not special as the sequence {1, 5, 5} is not strictly increasing.\nNow, provided an array A of size M, a number K and a range L, R, output the count of special numbers in the range provided those special numbers satisfy the following condition:\n(i) In the special number the length of the largest increasing/decreasing sequence should be less than or equal to K.\n(ii) The special numbers can be made of any digit between 1 to 9 and these digits can occur any number of times provided all the given digits in array A occur at least once in the number.\nInput\n\nFirst line will contain single integer T, denoting the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nFirst line of each testcase contains an integer M\nSecond line contains M space-separated integers A1, A2, \xe2\x80\xa6, AM\nThird line contains a single integer K\nFourth line contains two integers L and R\n\nOutput\nYou have to print the count of special numbers satisfying the given conditions in the given range L and R (both inclusive).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa415\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa49\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa49\nArray elements are distinct.  \n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa49\n1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4 1018\n\nSample Input\n2\n2\n1 2\n2\n10 200\n3\n3 5 7\n3\n100000 200000\n\nSample Output\n10\n1958\n\nSample Explanation\nThe Special numbers in the given range for the test case 1 are-\n12\n21\n121\n132\n142\n152\n162 \n172\n182\n192\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85shauryakr\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CR191\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cord2019, digit-dp, medium, shauryakr\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-02-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
