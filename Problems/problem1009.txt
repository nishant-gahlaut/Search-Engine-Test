b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef is an advocate for Go Green Initiative. Today he had n trees planted in a row outside his his restaurant. Today, the height of i-th tree is hi feet. The trees grow at a rate of mi feet per day.\nChef knows that trees will look beautiful if they form a zig-zag sequence. The trees will be said to be in Zig-zag sequence if the heights of tree first increases or decreases, then alternates between decreasing/increasing respectively. Formally, the trees will be said to in Zig-zag sequence if one of the following two conditions holds.\n\n\nh1 < h2 > h3 < h4 and so on..\nh1 >  h2 < h3 > h4 and so on..\n\n\nChef wants to know intervals of time when the heights of the trees will form a zig-zag sequence.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n, denoting the number of trees.\nThe ith of following N lines contains two space separated integers hi and mi, denoting the initial height and the growth speed for ith tree.\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nFor each test case, output an integer Q - the amount of the periods of consecutive moments of time, when the trees for a zig-zag sequence.\nOn the following Q lines, output the intervals of time when the trees' heights form a zig-zag sequence. For each intervals, output its' smallest and the largest instants of time. If the range is infinite, output Inf as the right bound.\nThe test cases are designed in such a way that the total output won't exceed 2 MB.\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 10\nSubtask 1 (23 points): 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 hi, mi \xe2\x89\xa4 10\nSubtask 2 (77 points): 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 hi, mi \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of n over a test cases in a single test file \xe2\x89\xa4 5 \xc3\x97 105\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n3\n0 1\n2 2\n0 3\n2\n2 1\n1 2\n3\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n\nOutput:\n1\n0 1\n2\n0 0\n2 Inf\n0\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.
