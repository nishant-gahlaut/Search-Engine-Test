b"\nRead problem statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThis is an interactive problem.\nThe jury has a binary string SS of length NN consisting of the characters 00 and 11. It has K\xe2\x89\xa51K\xe2\x89\xa51 characters 11.\nYou need to make exactly NN guesses on the value of KK. After the ii-th guess GiGi, you will be given SiSi (the ii-th character of SS).\nYou win if there exists some jj (1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4N) such that Gj=KGj=K and Sj=1Sj=1. Find a way to win.\nInput Format\n\nBegin by reading a line containing a single integer NN. Afterwards, you should make exactly NN guesses.\nTo make the ii-th guess (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), you should output a single integer GiGi (1\xe2\x89\xa4Gi\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4Gi\xe2\x89\xa4N). In response, you should read in a single character \xe2\x80\x94 the ii-th character of SS.\nAfter exactly NN guesses, your program should exit the interaction protocol. Otherwise, you may receive any verdict.\n\nAfter printing a guess, do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output.\nThe interactor is adaptive. That is, the string SS is not fixed before the interaction and can change depending on your guesses.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa450001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45000\nAll characters of SS are 00 or 11.\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n4\n2\n2\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the example N=5N=5 and S=01010S=01010, so K=2K=2. The interaction proceeds as follows.\ni12345Guess (contestant)54223Response (interactor)01010iGuess (contestant)Response (interactor)150241320421530\nThe contestant wins, since G4=KG4=K and S4=1S4=1. Note that although the contestant won before all NN guesses, the programs are required to interact for all NN guesses. Also note that the contestant doesn't win at i=3i=3, since S3\xe2\x89\xa01S3\xe2\x89\xa01 (even though KK is guessed correctly).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85flamestorm153\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ONESGUESS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, flamestorm153, snckfl21, snckfp21\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-01-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
