b'\nYou are given an undirected tree having N nodes. The color of each node is either Black or White.\nIn one step, you can choose a node u, toggle the color of the chosen node u, as well as toggle the colors of all the nodes v, such that {u,v} is an edge in the tree.\nCan you find out the minimum number of steps required to make the color of all the nodes black?\nNote: Since the input is large, prefer using fast input methods.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of the T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line of each test case contains N space separated integers A1,A2,...,AN. Ai = 0 represents that the initial color of the ith node is black. Ai = 1 represents that the initial color of the ith node is white.\nThe following N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contain two space-separated integers x and y, which denotes that there is an edge between nodes x and y. \n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line the minimum number of steps required to make the color of all the nodes black.\nOutput \xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to make the color of all the nodes black.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N\nThe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n0 0 0\n1 2\n1 3\n3\n1 1 1\n1 2\n1 3\n3\n0 1 0\n1 2\n1 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: All the nodes are already black, so we do not need to do anything.\nTest Case 2: All the nodes are white. If we choose node 1 in the first step, all the nodes will become black. Hence, only 1 step is required to make all the nodes black. \nTest Case 3: Choose node 3 in the first step. This will make all the nodes white. Choose node 1 in the second step. This will make all the nodes black. \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85lavish315\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BAWTREE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Dynamic Programming, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3008\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-10-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
