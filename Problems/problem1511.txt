b"\nRead problem statements in Russian, Mandarin and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given two increasing arrays of NN integers x1<x2<\xe2\x80\xa6<xN and y1<y2<\xe2\x80\xa6<yN.\nFor a permutation \xcf\x831,\xcf\x832,\xe2\x80\xa6,\xcf\x83N of integers 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N, let's define A(\xcf\x83) in the following way:\n\nConsider the points (x1,y\xcf\x831),(x2,y\xcf\x832),\xe2\x80\xa6,(xN,y\xcf\x83N). Then A(\xcf\x83) equals to the area of the convex hull of these points.\n\nLet S be the sum of A(\xcf\x83) over all n! permutations. One can show that 2S is an integer under the constraints of the problem.\nFind the remainder of 2S modulo 998244353.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N \xe2\x88\x92 the length of the two arrays.\nThe second line of each test case contains N integers x1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xN (x1<x2<\xe2\x80\xa6<xN).\nThe third line of each test case contains N integers y1,y2,\xe2\x80\xa6,yN (y1<y2<\xe2\x80\xa6<yN).\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case print the remainder of 2S modulo 998244353.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa430\n\xe2\x88\x921000\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa41000\n\xe2\x88\x921000\xe2\x89\xa4yi\xe2\x89\xa41000\nThe sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 30\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n1 2 3\n1 2 3\n4\n-141 21 321 525\n131 452 653 893\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n12\n9662004\n\n\nExplanation\nHere are the weights of all permutations from the first test case:\n\nFor \xcf\x83=(1,2,3), we have points (1,1),(2,2),(3,3). They are collinear, so area of their convex hull is 0: A(\xcf\x83)=0.\nFor \xcf\x83=(1,3,2), we have points (1,1),(2,3),(3,2). Their convex hull is the triangle with vertices in them, and its area is 32: A(\xcf\x83)=32.\nFor \xcf\x83=(2,1,3), we have points (1,2),(2,1),(3,3). Their convex hull is the triangle with vertices in them, and its area is 32: A(\xcf\x83)=32.\nFor \xcf\x83=(2,3,1), we have points (1,2),(2,3),(3,1). Their convex hull is the triangle with vertices in them, and its area is 32: A(\xcf\x83)=32.\nFor \xcf\x83=(3,1,2), we have points (1,3),(2,1),(3,2). Their convex hull is the triangle with vertices in them, and its area is 32: A(\xcf\x83)=32.\nFor \xcf\x83=(3,2,1), we have points (1,3),(2,2),(3,1). They are collinear, so area of their convex hull is 0: A(\xcf\x83)=0.\n\nSum of these values is 6, so the answer to this test case is 2\xe2\x8b\x856=12.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85dario2994\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RNDCHULL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Computational Geometry\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3281\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-12-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n4 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
