Of course, he has a sequence a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aNa1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN ready for this occasion. Since the half-heart necklace is kind of cliche, he decided to cut his sequence into two pieces and give her a piece instead. Formally, he wants to choose an integer ll (1\xe2\x89\xa4l<N1\xe2\x89\xa4l<N) and split the sequence into its prefix with length ll and its suffix with length N\xe2\x88\x92lN\xe2\x88\x92l.\nChef wants his gift to be cute; he thinks that it will be cute if the product of the elements in Chefina's piece is coprime with the product of the elements in his piece. Can you tell him where to cut the sequence? Find the smallest valid ll such that Chef's gift would be cute.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains the integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aNa1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer ll where Chef should cut the sequence.\nIt is guaranteed that a solution exists for the given test data.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4201\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa420\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4105 for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (25 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa4200N\xe2\x89\xa4200\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 600600\n\nSubtask #2 (40 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa42,000N\xe2\x89\xa42,000\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 6,0006,000\n\nSubtask #3 (35 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4\n2 3 4 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mohammed200218\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COPAR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Difference Arrays, Prime Divisors\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Mathematics, Number Theory, Integer Factorisation, Divisors\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2235\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-10-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
