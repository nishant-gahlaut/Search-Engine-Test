b'\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Russian, Mandarin and Vietnamese as well.\nChef is given two integers N and M. Please help Chef find any connected undirected graph G consisting of exactly N vertices and M edges, such that the number of bridges in G is maximized (among all graphs with N vertices and M edges). G cannot have self-loops or multiple edges.\nIf there is more than one connected undirected graph with the maximum number of bridges, you may print any one of them.\nNote:\nA bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components of the graph.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nEach testcase consists of a single line of input, containing two integers N,M - the number of vertices and edges of the graph you must construct.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output M lines where the i-th line contains two space-separated integers denoting the i-th edge of the graph G you constructed. The edges may be printed in any order, and for each edge the endpoints may be printed in any order.\nNote that G must not contain self-loops or multiple edges, and no other graph on N vertices and M edges can contain strictly more bridges than G.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\nN\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4min(N\xe2\x8b\x85(N\xe2\x88\x921)/2,105)\nSum of N over all test cases do not exceed 103\nSum of M over all test cases do not exceed 105\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (100 points): Original constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n4 4\n5 4\n3 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n1 3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: There is exactly 1 bridge in the graph and it cannot be increased further.\n\n\n\nTest case 2: Since M=N\xe2\x88\x921 and we are required to output a connected graph, the graph will always be a tree and hence have 4 bridges. Any tree is acceptable here.\n\n\n\nTest case 3: Since M=N\xe2\x8b\x85(N\xe2\x88\x921)/2 our only choice is a complete graph, which has 0 bridges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nutkarsh_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MAXBRIDGE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Graph Algos, Constructive\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1972\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-11-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
