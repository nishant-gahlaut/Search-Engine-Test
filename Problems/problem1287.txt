b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nLeha is a bright mathematician. Today he is investigating whether an integer is divisible by some square number or not.\nHe has a positive integer X represented as a product of N integers a1, a2, .... aN. He has somehow figured out that there exists some integer P such that the number X is divisible by P2, but he is not able to find such P himself. Can you find it for him? If there are more than one possible values of P possible, you can print any one of them.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer N denoting the number of intgers in presentation of X.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers a1, a2, .... aN.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer P deoting the answer for this test case. Note that P must be in range from 2 to 1018 inclusive. It's guaranteed that at least one answer exists. If there are more than one possible answers, print any.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ai \xe2\x89\xa4 1018\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1[19 points]: 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 a1*a2*...*aN \xe2\x89\xa4 106\nSubtask 2[22 points]: 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 a1*a2*...*aN \xe2\x89\xa4 1012\nSubtask 3[23 points]: 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ai \xe2\x89\xa4 1012\nSubtask 4[36 points]: no additional constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3\n21 11 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. X = 21 * 11 * 6 = 1386. It's divisible by 9 which is a square number, as 9 = 32. So P = 3.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85pavel1996\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85karanaggarwal\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SQNUMBF\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 GCD, Integer Factorisation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2337\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-06-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
