b"\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nYou are given a rooted tree with NN nodes (numbered 1 through N). Node 1 is the root. You are also given integer sequences x1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xN and v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vN.\nLet S be a subset of nodes. It is called valid if it is non-empty and the following conditions hold:\n\nThere is no pair of nodes (i,j) such that i,j\xe2\x88\x88S and i is an ancestor of j.\nThe greatest common divisor of the values xi for all nodes i\xe2\x88\x88S (let's denote it by G) is greater than 1.\n\nNext, let's define the value of S as G\xe2\x8b\x85V, where G is defined above and V=\xe2\x88\x91i\xe2\x88\x88Svi.\nYou need to find a valid subset of nodes with the maximum value.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting that nodes u and v are connected by an edge.\nN lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers xi and vi.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print three lines.\n\nThe first of these lines should contain two space-separated integers G\xe2\x8b\x85V and G for your chosen subset.\nThe second line should contain a single integer K \xe2\x80\x95 the size of your subset.\nThe third line should contain K space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x95 the numbers of the nodes in this subset (in any order).\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe graph described on the input is a tree\n1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,vi\xe2\x89\xa4100,000 for each valid i\nat least one valid subset exists\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 1,000,000\n\nExample Input\n1\n6\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n5 6\n3 12\n2 10\n10 3\n6 6\n3 8\n15 2\n\nExample Output\n42 3\n2\n5 4\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85smartnj\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TREESUB\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, DP on Trees, GCD, Divisors, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Mathematics, Number Theory, Integer Factorisation, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3332\n\n\nDate Added:\n31-03-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
