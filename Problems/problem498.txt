Each cooling rack can only hold one pie, and each pie may only be held by one cooling rack,\nbut the chef isn't confident that the cooling racks can support the weight of the pies.\nThe chef knows the weight of each pie,\nand has assigned each cooling rack a maximum weight limit.\nWhat is the maximum number of pies the chef can cool on the racks?\nInput:\nInput begins with an integer T\xe2\x89\xa430, the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of 3 lines.\nThe first line of each test case contains a positive integer N\xe2\x89\xa430,\nthe number of pies (and also the number of racks).\nThe second and third lines each contain exactly positive N integers not exceeding 100.\nThe integers on the second line are the weights of the pies, and the integers on the third line\nare the weight limits of the cooling racks.\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output on a line the maximum number of pies the chef can place on the racks.\nSample input:\n2\n3\n10 30 20\n30 10 20\n5\n9 7 16 4 8\n8 3 14 10 10\n \nSample output:\n3\n4\n \n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndavid_adm\n\n\nTester:\nMaksflow\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COOLING\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cook03, david_adm, easy\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-09-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.61 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
