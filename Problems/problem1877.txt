b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n\nPishty is a little boy who lives in Khust, an ancient town with a castle and smart bears. Right now, he wants you to help him with a programming problem.\n\n\nYou are given a sequence A1, A2, ..., AN and Q queries. There are two types of queries:\n\n1 pos val \xe2\x80\x94 Set Apos = val.\n2 l r \xe2\x80\x94 Find the maximum possible perimeter of a triangle with non-zero area whose sides are elements of the subsequence Al, Al+1, ..., Ar. Note that each element of the subsequence can only be used as the length of at most one side, i.e. the sides of each valid triangle must be elements Ax, Ay, Az, where l \xe2\x89\xa4 x < y < z \xe2\x89\xa4 r.\n\n\n\nFor each query of the second type, compute the maximum possible perimeter or determine that no valid triangle exists.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and Q.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.\nQ lines follow. Each of these lines describes one query in the following format:\n\n1 pos val for a query of the first type\n2 l r for a query of the second type\n\n\nOutput\nFor each query of the second type, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum perimeter or 0 if no triangle can be formed.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, Q \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109 for each valid i\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 val \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 l \xe2\x89\xa4 r \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 pos \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n\n Subtasks:\nSubtask #1 (5 pts): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, Q \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nSubtask #2 (25 pts): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, Q \xe2\x89\xa4 2000\nSubtask #3 (70 pts): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5 4\n3 1 8 9 7\n2 1 5\n1 2 12\n2 1 3\n2 2 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n24\n0\n29\n\n\nExplanation\nThe first query asks us to find the maximum perimeter of a triangle using some of the elements {3, 1, 8, 9, 7}. We can take the elements 7, 8, and 9 and construct a triangle using these three elements as side lengths. This triangle has perimeter 7 + 8 + 9 = 24, which is the maximum possible perimeter. Hence the answer is 24.\nThe second query asks us to change the second element to 12.\nThe third query asks us to find the maximum perimeter of a triangle using some of the elements {3, 12, 8}. These three elements do not form a triangle, hence the answer is 0.\nThe fourth query asks us to find the maximum perimeter of a triangle using some of the elements {12, 8, 9, 7}. We can take the elements 8, 9 and 12 and make a triangle using these three elements as side lengths. This triangle has perimeter 8 + 9 + 12 = 29, which is maximum possible. Hence the answer is 29.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85fekete\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PSHTRG\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Segment Trees, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2261\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-12-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
