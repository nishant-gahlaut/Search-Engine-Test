b'\nEverybody knows that there are a lot of complicated problems on CodeChef and it\xe2\x80\x99s quite difficult to solve them. However, very few people know that testing these problems is much more elaborate process than solving. Hosting Chef\xe2\x80\x99s great contests would be impossible without his testers - Anton and Hiroto. The number of problems they solved and tested probably won\xe2\x80\x99t fit in 32-bit integer. These guys do very big amount of work and of course they also need to have a rest. They are having vacation for the next ten days. Of course, they\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen ChefLand as a place to go. \n\nThere are N cities in ChefLand and every city is denoted by its integer number. Surprisingly these numbers are not to be distinct. Anton is fond of Math so he quickly counted the sum of squares of all positive integer divisors for every this number; let\xe2\x80\x99s call this sum for number that denotes ith city S(i). Hiroto considers city i to be beautiful if S(i) is odd, otherwise it is ugly for him. \n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s important to mention that the cities of ChefLand are connected by bidirectional roads. It took Hiroto a couple of seconds to notice that there are exactly N-1 roads and that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to reach every city from every other city by existing roads. \n\nOur testers want their vacation to consist of interesting trips. Formally trip is a path between two cities (Anton swears that there is an unique path between each pair of cities, so let\xe2\x80\x99s trust him:)); the length of the trip is a number of cities it consists of. Furthermore, visiting of a single city is also a trip of length 1. The time of having any trip is equal to its length. Hiroto considers a trip to be interesting if the number of beautiful cities in it is not less than the number of ugly cities. \n\nAnton and Hiroto want to try every interesting trip. Since our testers are very smart and provident, they want to know the exact time it will take them to go through all the interesting trips. Note that if they had a trip from A to B then they are not interested in having trip from B to A.\n\n\nInput\nThe first line contains single integer N \xe2\x80\x93 the number of cities in ChefLand. Then N-1 lines follow \xe2\x80\x93 description of the roads. Each road is described by a pair of integers in [1, N] range. Then you are given N numbers in the next line. Ith of them is the number that denotes city i.\n\nOutput\nThe first and only line of the output should contain the total length of all the interesting trips.\n\nConstrains\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 300000 (3*105)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Number that denotes any city \xe2\x89\xa4 1500000 (1.5*106)\nExample\nInput:\n3\n1 2\n1 3\n3 1 1 \n\nOutput:\n9\n\nExplanation\nHere we have S(2)=S(3)=1 and S(1)=10 (1 + 32), so the first city is ugly and other two are beautiful. \n(2, 2) \xe2\x80\x93 1\n(3, 3) \xe2\x80\x93 1\n(1, 2) \xe2\x80\x93 2\n(1, 3) \xe2\x80\x93 2\n(2, 3) \xe2\x80\x93 3\n1+1+2+2+3=9\nThe (1, 1) trip is not interesting. \n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nroman_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85laycurse\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TESTERS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Fenwick Trees, Centroid Decomposition, Divide and Conquer, BFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos, Algorithms, Recursion, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2730\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-12-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
