b"\nRead problem statements in Mandarin, Bengali, and Russian as well.\nAlice and Bob have a permutation of size NN, so they started playing a game on it. They both have their own copies of an initial permutation on which they perform moves in turns. Note that although Bob's and Alice's permutations are initially similar in values, they are the not the same permutation; any move Alice makes only changes her permutation and not Bob's, and vice versa.\nAlice goes first. In one move, they can do the following on their respective permutations:\n\nChoose two indices i and j and swap Pi and Pj.\n\nThe player who sorts their permutation first, wins the game.\nBoth players play optimally. But unfortunately, on playing a lot of games, Alice won all of those. Bob realized that something is unfair and told Alice to play with some handicap.\nSo they mutually agreed that, Alice is given an extra potential array V of size N. Now Alice can do the following move only:\n\nChoose two indices i and j such that, 0<Vi AND 0<Vj.\nIf no such indices exist, skip her turn.\nElse swap Pi and Pj and then decrement Vi and Vj by 1.\n\nBob plays as usual without any potential array. Alice goes first.\nReport who wins if both play optimally, and find the strategy for the winner. You also need to determine the shortest sequence of moves to victory.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N - the size of the permutation.\nThe next line contains N space separated integers P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN.\nThe next line contains N space separated integers V1,V2,\xe2\x80\xa6,VN.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case:\n\nOutput on the first line the winner of the match, i.e. Alice or Bob. You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings Alice, ALICE, alIcE and aLiCe will all be treated as identical).\nOutput on the next line an integer M - the minimum number of moves taken by the winner.\nThen output M lines, where the i-th line contains two integers denoting the i-th move by the winner.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Vi\xe2\x89\xa4109\nP1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN form a permutation of values from 1 to N\n\xe2\x88\x91N over all test cases is at most 105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n10\n1 8 10 4 2 5 7 9 3 6\n2 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 2\n10\n6 2 9 1 7 8 10 5 3 4\n2 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nBob\n6\n2 8\n2 9\n2 3\n2 10\n2 6\n2 5\nALiCE\n7\n3 9\n1 4\n4 10\n10 7\n7 5\n5 8\n8 6\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85anshugarg12\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SRTGAME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sets, Greedy, Cycles, Constructive, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms, Graph Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2862\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-10-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
