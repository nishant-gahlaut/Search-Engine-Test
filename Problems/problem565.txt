b"\nAlice is teaching Bob maths via a game called N-guesser.\nAlice has a positive integer N which Bob needs to guess. She gives him two pieces of information with which to do this:\n\nA positive integer X, which denotes the sum of divisors of N.\nTwo positive integers A and B, which denote that the sum of reciprocals of divisors of N is A/B.\n\nBob either needs to guess N or tell that no such number exists.\nIt can be shown that if a valid N exists, it is unique.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nEach test case consists of a single line of input, containing three space-separated integers X,A,B.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output a new line containing the answer \xe2\x80\x94 Alice's number N, or \xe2\x88\x921 if no such number exists.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa4109\ngcd(A,B)=1\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4 4 3\n4 1 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: The divisors of 3 are 1 and 3. Their sum is 4 and the sum of their reciprocals is 4/3.\nTest case 2: It can be proved that no positive integer N exists whose divisors sum to 4 and reciprocals of divisors sum to 1.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85harsh2511\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DIVREC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, harsh2511, number-theory, start24\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1848\n\n\nDate Added:\n31-01-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
