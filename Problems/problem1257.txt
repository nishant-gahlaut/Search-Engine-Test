b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a string AA with length N. It contains only characters '(', ')' and '*'. Chef wants to perform the following process:\n\nUniformly randomly choose a pair of integers (l,r) such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N.\nConsider the substring S=[Al,Al+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ar]. Process the characters of this string from left to right.\nLet's denote the current number of closing brackets in S up to the currently processed character (inclusive) by nc. Similarly, let's denote the number of opening brackets by no. Note that the string S may change; nc and no correspond to the current state of S, not its initial state.\nWhenever nc becomes greater than no, the currently processed character must be ')'. Then, change it from ')' to '(' and continue processing the remaining characters of S.\n\nChef would like to know the expected number of characters that he would change in this process. Can you help him?\nIt can be proved that this expected value can be expressed as a fraction P/Q, where P and Q are non-negative integers and Q is coprime to 109+7. You should find P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 109+7, where Q\xe2\x88\x921 denotes the multiplicative inverse of Q modulo 109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains a single string A with length N.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4107\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 107\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (5 points): N\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSubtask #2 (15 points): N\xe2\x89\xa45,000\nSubtask #3 (30 points): N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nSubtask #4 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n((())\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n866666673\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85foyaz05\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EXPCH\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Combinatorics, DP Approach, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n31-12-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
