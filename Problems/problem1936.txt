b'\n\nChef Ciel got enormous cooking power from the Evil Book.\nInstead, Ciel must devote 666 magical power to the Evil Book.\n\n\nOther than Ciel, there are N chefs in the world.\nThe i-th chef has Ci cooking power and Mi magical power.\nCiel may get Mi magical power by defeating the i-th chef in a cooking battle, which needs Ci effort.\nAfter that, the i-th chef\'s magical power Mi becomes 0.\n\n\nThe Evil Book can help her, if she gives X magical power to the Evil Book.\nThat is, by consuming X magical power, she can choose some i and multiply by 1/3 both the i-th chef\'s cooking power Ci and his magical power Mi.\nNote that she can\'t take the help of the Evil Book unless she has at least X magical power.\n\n\nFirstly, Ciel has no magical power.\nWhat\'s the minimum total effort for collecting at least 666 magical power?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.\nThen T test cases follow.\nEach test case contains N+1 lines.\nThe first line for each test case has 2 integers N and X.\nThe (i+1)-th line for each test case has 2 integers Ci and Mi.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print the minimum total effort (rounded to the nearest integer) for collecting at least 666 magical power.\nIf it is impossible to collect 666 magical power, print "impossible" without quotes.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n10 \xe2\x89\xa4 X < 666\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ci \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000000 (109)\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Mi \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000000 (109)\n\nSample Input\n4\n4 10\n1 30\n110 500\n200 700\n190 800\n2 665\n1 250\n2 415\n2 10\n1000000000 1000000000\n1000000000 1000000000\n2 10\n1000000000 1000000000\n0 130\nSample Output\n168\nimpossible\n1000000000\n1882\nOutput details\n\nIn the first case, the optimal way is the following.\n\n\nInitially, Ciel\'s magical power = 0, Total effort = 0\nC1 = 1, M1 = 30\nC2 = 110, M2 = 500\nC3 = 200, M3 = 700\nC4 = 190, M4 = 800\n\n\nAfter defeating the 1st chef:\nCiel\'s magical power = 30, Total effort = 1\nC1 = 1, M1 = 0\nC2 = 110, M2 = 500\nC3 = 200, M3 = 700\nC4 = 190, M4 = 800\n\n\nAfter using 3 helps of the Evil Book (i = 2, 3, 4):\nCiel\'s magical power = 0, Total effort = 1\nC1 = 1, M1 = 0\nC2 = 36+2/3, M2 = 166+2/3\nC3 = 66+2/3, M3 = 233+1/3\nC4 = 63+1/3, M4 = 266+2/3\n\n\nAfter defeating the 2nd, 3rd and 4th chefs:\nCiel\'s magical power = 666+2/3, Total effort = 167+2/3 (1 + 36+2/3 + 66+2/3 + 63+1/3)\nC1 = 10, M1 = 0\nC2 = 36+2/3, M2 = 0\nC3 = 66+2/3, M3 = 0\nC4 = 63+1/3, M4 = 0\n\n\nIn the fourth case, Ciel should defeat the 2nd chef at first.\nThen, after using 12 helps of the Evil Book, the 1st chef\'s cooking power and magical power become 109 / 312 = 1881.67642...\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nhiroto_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85anton_lunyov\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EVILBOOK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy, DFS, Brute Force\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2490\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-09-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.246486 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
