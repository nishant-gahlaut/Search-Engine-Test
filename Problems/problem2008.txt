b'\n\nGiven an n*m board with a number between -1 and n*m in every entries.\n\nAnd an n*m matrix M is also given, where Mi,j is the cost of selecting the (i,j) entry of the given board.\n\nYour task is to find a connected block (which means these entries can reach each other by just go up, down, left and right without going out the block) in the board that contains at least K distinct positive numbers without any -1, and it must have minimum total cost for selecting these entries. Output the minimum total cost.\n\nInput\nFirst line consists of three integers, n, m, K (1 <= n, m <= 15, 1 <= K <= 7).\n\nThe followings are two n*m matrices, the first denotes the numbers on the board and the second denotes the cost of every entry.\n\nNamely, the first n lines contain m integers, where the jth number in ith line denotes the number on the entry (i,j) of the board. These integers are in [-1, n*m].\n\nNext n lines contain m integers too. The jth number in ith line denotes the cost of selecting the entry (i,j) of the board. These integers are in [1, 100000].\n\nOutput\n\nOnly one line contains the minimum cost to finish the task. If the task is impossible, output -1 please.\nExample\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 0 1 \n2 3 3 \n-1 2 1 \n3 1 5 \n4 10 1 \n9 3 4 \nOutput:\n8\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\njingbo_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85laycurse\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CONNECT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Randomized Algorithms, DP Approach\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2949\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-02-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.788732 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
