b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are NN candies (numbered 11 through NN) on a circular table. For each valid ii, candies ii and i+1i+1 are adjacent; candies 11 and NN are also adjacent. You want to eat all these candies.\nInitially, your happiness level is 00. For each valid ii, when you eat the ii-th candy, the happiness level increases by aiai. Note that aiai may be negative and your happiness level may also become negative.\nFirst, you should eat the candy 11. After that, while there is at least one uneaten candy, you may eat any candy that is adjacent to at least one of the candies eaten so far.\nYour goal is to maximise the smallest value of your happiness during this process.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aNa1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum possible minimum happiness value during the process.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4200,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4200,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200,000\n|ai|\xe2\x89\xa4109|ai|\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 200,000200,000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa420N\xe2\x89\xa420\nSubtask #2 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa4300N\xe2\x89\xa4300\nSubtask #3 (80 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n1 2 3\n3\n-10 -20 30\n3\n-1 0 0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n-10\n-1\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nildar_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CIRCLEAT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 binary-search, data-structure, hard, ildar_adm, ltime90, range-queries\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2971\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-11-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
