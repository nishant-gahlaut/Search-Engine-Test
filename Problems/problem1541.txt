b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nYou have been given a string T with n lowercase letters T[1..n]. For each substrings T[l..r], we can assign them two values, k1 and k2, which are defined as following.\n\nk1 is the number of different substrings which are lexicographically smaller than T[l..r]. There are (n + 1) * n / 2 substrings in total.\nk2 indicates the number of substrings which are as same as T[l..r] but have smaller left subscript than l.\n\n\nIn this problem, you need to answer the following two queries:\n\n\nSelect k1 k2: report l and r, such that T[l..r] are assigned values k1 and k2.\nRank l r: output the assigned k1 and k2 of T[l..r].\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a string T with n letters . The second line contains a number m, which represents for the totally number of queries.\n\n\nEach of the following m lines contains a query. All queries are formed as "Select k1 k2" or "Rank l r".\n\nOutput\nFor each query, output the corresponding answer as the form "l r" or "k1 k2" in a single line.\nConstraints\n\n1 <= n <= 10^6\n1 <= m <= 10^6\n1 <= l <= r <= n\nk1, k2 are legal.\n\nExample\nInput:\naa\n6\nSelect 1 1\nSelect 1 2\nSelect 2 1\nRank 1 1\nRank 2 2\nRank 1 2\nOutput:\n1 1\n2 2\n1 2\n1 1\n1 2\n2 1\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85xiaodao\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85shangjingbo\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/QSTRING\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 medium, oct14, suffix-array, xiaodao\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2769\n\n\nDate Added:\n6-09-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 - 10 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
