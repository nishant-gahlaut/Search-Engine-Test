Each problem has SS subtasks (numbered 11 through SS).\nThe difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet's denote the score of the kk-th subtask of this problem by SCkSCk and the number of contestants who solved it by NSkNSk.\nConsider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.\nCalculate the number nn of valid indices kk such that NSk>NSk+1NSk>NSk+1.\nFor problem ii, the difficulty is a pair of integers (n,i)(n,i).\n\nYou should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem aa is more difficult than problem bb if the number nn is greater for problem aa than for problem bb, or if a>ba>b and nn is the same for problems aa and bb.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers PP and SS denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.\n2P2P lines follow. For each valid ii, the 2i\xe2\x88\x9212i\xe2\x88\x921-th of these lines contains SS space-separated integers SC1,SC2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SCSSC1,SC2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SCS denoting the scores of the ii-th problem's subtasks, and the 2i2i-th of these lines contains SS space-separated integers NS1,NS2,\xe2\x80\xa6,NSSNS1,NS2,\xe2\x80\xa6,NSS denoting the number of contestants who solved the ii-th problem's subtasks.\n\nOutput\nPrint PP lines containing one integer each \xe2\x80\x94 the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4P\xe2\x89\xa4100,0001\xe2\x89\xa4P\xe2\x89\xa4100,000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa4302\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa430\n1\xe2\x89\xa4SCi\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4SCi\xe2\x89\xa4100 for each valid ii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4NSi\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4NSi\xe2\x89\xa41,000 for each valid ii\nin each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (25 points): S=2S=2\nSubtask #2 (75 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3 3\n16 24 60\n498 861 589\n14 24 62\n72 557 819\n16 15 69\n435 779 232\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85vidyut_1\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PROBLEMS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1601\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-06-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
