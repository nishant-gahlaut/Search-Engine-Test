While they had to wait for help from another dimension, they decided to play a random game with the following rules:\n\nInitially, they are given a number NN by Birdman.\nThe players (Rick and Morty) alternate turns, starting with Rick.\nIn each turn, if NN is even, the current player must divide NN by 22. Otherwise, the current player must either increase or decrease NN by 11.\nIf NN becomes 00 afterwards, the current player (the player who made NN equal to 00) wins the game.\n\nYou are playing the game for Rick. First, you must decide if it is possible to win the game for a given starting value of NN if both players play optimally. If it is possible, you must also play and win the game.\nInteraction\n\nFirst, you should read a line containing a single integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of test cases TT. The description of interaction for TT test cases follows.\nFor each test case, first, you should read a line containing a single integer \xe2\x80\x95 the initial value of NN.\nThen, you should print a line containing the string "Win" if you can win the game or "Lose" if you cannot win.\nIf you printed "Lose", you should read a line containing a single string. If this string is "WA", you could have actually won, so you should terminate your program immediately. Otherwise, this string is "GG" and you should continue solving the remaining test cases.\nIf you printed "Win", you should continue by playing the game. When it is your turn:\nYou should print a line containing a single string describing your move \xe2\x80\x94 "/2" if NN is even or one of the strings "+1" or "-1" if NN is odd.\nThen, you should read a line containing a single string.\nIf NN became 00 and you won the game, this string is "GG" and you should continue solving the remaining test cases.\nIf the move you made was invalid (for example, you printed an invalid line), this string is "WA" and you should terminate your program immediately.\nOtherwise, this string is "+1", "-1" or "/2" and describes Morty\'s move in the following turn. If NN becomes 00 after this move, you lost the game and you should also terminate your program immediately.\n\nWhenever you lose a game, make an invalid move or incorrectly decide that you could not have won some game, your submission is incorrect. If you terminate your program immediately afterwards, you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, you may receive any verdict.\nIt is guaranteed that the grader plays optimally and never makes an invalid move.\nDon\'t forget to flush the output after printing each line!\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410181\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41018\n\nExample\nGrader                 You\n3\n1\n                       Win\n                       -1\nGG\n6\n                       Lose\nGG\n7\n                       Win\n                       +1\n/2\n                       /2\n/2\n                       -1\nGG\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mathecodician\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RANDGAME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Top-down, Game Theory\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, DP Approach\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2202\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-04-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
