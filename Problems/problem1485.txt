b'\nMayank is very fond of geometry. He already knows about the general equation of line i.e. ax+by+c=0, where a,b and c are coefficients and x and y are variables. Today, He learned about the parallel lines. The parallel lines are the lines that will never meet at any point. Read more on Wikipedia.\nNow he has a set of N lines. There can be many subsets of this set in which all the lines are parallel to each other.\nHelp him to find the length of maximum such subset.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of lines. \nNext N lines contains three space-separated integers a, b and c denoting the coefficients of the ith lines.\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the length of maximum subset of parallel lines.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 20\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n|a|,|b|,|c| \xe2\x89\xa4 109\nFor a line with coefficients a, b and c either a or b is not zero.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n1\n5\n1 0 0\n1 2 3\n3 4 5\n30 40 0\n30 40 50\n\nOutput:\n2\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nLines 3*x + 4*y + 5 = 0 and 30*x + 40*y + 0 = 0 form a biggest parallel subset.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85hsagarthegr8\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BITMASK4\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 geometry, hsagarthegr8, map, medium, set\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-04-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
