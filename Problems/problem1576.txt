b"\nYou are given a bag containing N balls, numbered from 1 to N, each having a given non-zero integral volume.\nThe likelihood of a ball being taken out of the bag is directly proportional to its volume. More specifically, the probability of a ball being taken out of the bag is equal to it's volume divided by the sum of volumes of all the balls in the bag at that point.\nYou are bored and decide to play a game. It has N Rounds. In the i-th Round, you want to find the ball numbered i. To do so, you take out balls one by one, without replacement, till you take out the ball numbered i. Then the Round ends, and you place all the balls back into the bag and proceed with the next Round.\nYou need to find, for each Round, what is the expected number of balls you would need to remove.\nPlease note that during a single Round, you do not replace any balls you remove. However, every Round starts from scratch with all the balls put in.\nInput\n\nThe first line of each input contains a single integer N, the number of balls in the bag.\nThe second line contains N integers, the ith integer representing the volume of the ith ball.\n\nOutput\nPrint N space separated values on a single line where the ith value is the expected number of balls you remove in Round i. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute error is less than or equal to 10-6 for each ball.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 103\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ball volumes \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n3 5\n\nOutput:\n1.625000 1.375000\n\nExplanation\nFinding expected number of balls removed in Round 1: The probability of extracting the first ball in the first try is 3/8. Therefore, we will either extract 1 ball with probability 3/8 or two balls with probability 5/8. Expected number of balls extracted therefore is 3/8 + 2 * (5/8) = 1.625.\nSimilarly for the second ball, 5/8 + 2 * (3/8) = 1.375\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85grebnesieh\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Expected Value\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Probability\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-12-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, PYPY\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
