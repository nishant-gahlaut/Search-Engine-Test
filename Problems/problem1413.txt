b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nChef passed all the exams. This month was really tiring. So, he decided to relax for a little bit. Well, there is no better way to relax than to play with sets of numbers.\nChef loves to solve problems about sets. That does not mean that he is any good at it. Anyway, he opened his favorite problemset archive, and there he found a task that he thinks is best suited to him. \nProblem description\nYou are given N sets and Q queries. Initially, each set consists only of a single element. The sets are indexed from 1 to N, and the ith set contains the number i. Each query may be one of the following two types.\n\n\nUNION a b - merge the ath and the bth. The new set will hold the index N + number of union operations before this one + 1. Also, after this operation, the ath set and the bth set will no longer exist.\nGET a k - find the kth smallest element in the set indexed a\n\n\nPlease help our dear Chef! :)\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains two integers N and Q denoting the number of sets in the very beginning and the number of queries. Each of the next Q lines contains one query per line - either UNION a b" or GET a k.\nOutput\nFor each query of second type (i.e. GET) output the number that you\'ve found.\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 2 * 105.\nAll the queries are valid, that is, for any query GET i p, the ith set exists, and has a size of at least p; and for any query UNION a b, the sets indexed as a as well as b exist.\nSubtask 1 (35 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, Q \xe2\x89\xa4 500\nSubtask 2 (65 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 2 * 105\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n7 8\nUNION 1 2\nUNION 8 3\nGET 4 1\nUNION 4 5\nGET 10 2\nGET 9 3\nGET 9 2\nGET 9 1\n\nOutput:\n4\n5\n3\n2\n1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\n\n\nInitially, the sets are: {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6}, {7}.\nAfter the first query: {}, {}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6}, {7}, {1, 2}. \nAfter the second query the configuration of sets is: {}, {}, {}, {4}, {5}, {6}, {7}, {}, {1, 2, 3}.\nThe third query: the set {4} contains only one number so the answer is 4\nThe configuration of sets after the fourth query: {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {6}, {7}, {}, {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5}\nThe fifth query: the second smallest element in {4, 5} is 5.\nFor queries 6, 7, 8, the set is {1, 2, 3}. \n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nfurko_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFDTRE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Treap, Splay Tree\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2578\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-06-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
