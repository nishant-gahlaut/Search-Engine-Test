b"\n \n Oj is a mischievous yet brilliant student of his class. Due to his mischievous activities, one day his maths teacher got fed up and challenged him to do few math problems. Oj, still being a pro student solved all questions from topics of calculus, matrices and equations but wasn't able to solve one question. The question asked to find the sum of all integers i from 1 to N such that  2i+1 is divisible by 3. You being a friend of Oj don't want to make him feel embarrassed and offered to help.\n \nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains an integer N as described above.\n\n \nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing a single integer which is the answer.\n \nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 108\n\n \nSubtask 1(20 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 30\n\n \nSubtask 2(80 points)\nOriginal Constraints\n \nExample\nInput:\n3\n1\n2\n3\nOutput:\n1\n1\n4\n\n \nExplanation\nExample case 1. For n=1, 21+1 = 3 is divisible by 3. Hence, sum=1\nExample case 2. For n=2, 22+1 = 5 is not divisible by 3. Hence, sum = 1 (being divisible by n=1 only)\nExample case 3. For n=3, 23+1 = 9 is divisible by 3. Hence, sum = 1+3=4 (being divisible by n=1,3)\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85rounaqwl66\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, modulo, proc1601, rounaqwl66\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-07-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
