b"\nImpressed by your performance in the class, your class teacher made you the class monitor. Your class has N students (excluding you) and the ith student has height hi. Every morning, the students of each class are required to assemble in the school ground for the morning prayers. Before moving to the ground, students of each class are arranged in lines and each line should be beautiful. A line is beautiful when it satisfies the following condition.\n\nLet the indices of the students in the line be s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sL. Then, \xe2\x88\x801<p\xe2\x89\xa4L,  hsp>hsp\xe2\x88\x921 and hsp\xe2\x89\xa10(modhsp\xe2\x88\x921). Basically, every student should have a height greater than the previous student and his/her height should also be divisible by the height of the previous student.\n\nBeing the monitor, you have to arrange the students of your class (excluding you) into some K lines. Each of these K lines should be beautiful. Monitoring many lines can be quite troublesome, hence, you want the number of lines K to be minimum.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains an integer N denoting the number of students in your class.\nThe second line contains N integers hi denoting the height of the students in your class.\n\nOutput Format\nOutput the minimum lines K you can arrange the students in such that each line is beautiful.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n2 3 4 5 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nWe can have 3 lines with students\n\n1\xe2\x86\x923\n2\xe2\x86\x925\n4\n\nHack case note\nFind the buggy solution to this problem on GitHub or Drive.\nThis problem is part of the DeCode contest, wherein you are given a problem (as given above) and its buggy solution (link in contest announcement). You have to submit a program that outputs a hack case to the buggy solution or you can submit the hack case directly as a text file (select TEXT as language while submitting). Your program's output or the hack case should satisfy the input constraints of the above problem.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85awesome_amul\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CLASSMONITOR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 awesome_amul, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-02-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
