b'\n\nThe Chef is enjoying a wonderful vacation in Byteland. What makes the Chef impressed the most is the road system of the country. Byteland has N cities numbered 1 through N. City 1 is the capital of Byteland. The country also has N-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities. The i-th road connects two different cities ui and vi. In this road system, people can travel between every pair of different cities by going through exactly one path of roads.\n\n\nThe roads are arranged in such a way that people can distinguish two cities only when both cities have different number of roads connected to it. Such two cities will be considered similar. For example, city A is similar to the capital if the number of roads connected to city A is equal to the number of roads connected to the capital.\n\n\nOn each day during the vacation, the Chef wants to have a trip as follows. He chooses two cities A and B such that the Chef will visit city B if he goes from A to the capital using the shortest path. Then, the Chef will visit the cities on the shortest path from A to B through this path. Please note that A may be equal to B; that means the Chef will enjoy the day in a single city.\n\n\nThe Chef does not want to have similar trips. Two trips are considered similar if and only if\nthey both have the same number of visited cities and for each i, the i-th city visited in one trip is similar to the i-th city visited in the other trip.\n\n\nThe Chef wants to have as many different, namely not similar, trips as possible. Help him count the maximum number of possible trips such that no two of them are similar.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer N. The i-th line of next N-1 lines contains two space-separated integers ui and vi, denoting the i-th road.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput a single line containing the maximum number of different trips.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100000 (105)ui \xe2\x89\xa0 vi\nEvery pair of different cities can be traveled by going through exactly one path of roads.\nSample\nInput:\n3\n2 1\n3 1\n\nOutput:\n3\n\nExplanation\n\nIn the sample, the country consists of three cities.\nThere are two roads. The first road connects city 1 and city 2.\nThe second road connects city 1 and city 3.\nEach day, the Chef can choose the following possible trips:\n\n\n\nA = 1, B = 1\n\n\nA = 2, B = 2\n\n\nA = 3, B = 3\n\n\nA = 2, B = 1\n\n\nA = 3, B = 1\n\n\n\nHowever, since the trip (A = 2, B = 2) is similar to the trip (A = 3, B = 3),\nand the trip (A = 2, B = 1) is similar to the trip (A = 3, B = 1),\nthere are only three possible different trips for the Chef.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ntuan_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85laycurse\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DIFTRIP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Suffix Arrays, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Suffix Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2548\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-09-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
