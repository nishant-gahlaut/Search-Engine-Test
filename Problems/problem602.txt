b'\nRead problem statements in Russian, Bengali, and Mandarin Chinese as well.\nThere are NN students standing in a canteen queue, numbered 1 to N from left to right. For each valid i, the i-th student has a height hi.\nTwo students i and j can see each other if there are no taller students standing between them. Formally, students i and j (i<j) can see each other if for each integer k (i<k<j), hk\xe2\x89\xa4hi,hj.\nFor each valid i, determine the number ci of students that have the same height as student i and can be seen by student i.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers h1,h2,\xe2\x80\xa6,hN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers c1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cN.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 103\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n1 2 2 3 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0 1 1 0 0\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Student 3 can see students 2 and 4, but only student 2 has the same height (height 2). On the other hand, student 3 cannot see student 5 since student 4 is taller and therefore blocking the view.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nnbmnb\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LUNCHTIM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Stacks, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1773\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-01-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
