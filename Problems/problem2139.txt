They are all currently located at the left bank; Chef wants all animals and himself to be located at the right bank at the end. Some of the animals do not get along with each other, so they must not be left unattended by Chef at the same bank at any point in time.\nThese restrictions are described by a tree with NN vertices; an edge between vertices uu and vv denotes that animals uu and vv do not get along with each other.\nThere is just a single boat with which Chef and the animals can cross the river. When the boat is crossing the river, Chef must be in the boat to steer it, possibly with zero or more animals; meanwhile, all animals that are not in the boat are left unattended.\nThe capacity of the boat is the maximum number of animals that can fit into the boat when crossing the river, plus 1 (for Chef).\nInitially, the tree consists only of vertex 11 (the root); the vertices 2,3,\xe2\x80\xa6,N2,3,\xe2\x80\xa6,N are added to the tree one by one in this order. Whenever a vertex is added, it is connected to exactly one of the vertices already present in the tree (its parent). After adding each vertex, you should compute the minimum required capacity of the boat such that it is possible for Chef and the animals to move to the right bank of the river.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 space-separated integers p2,p3,\xe2\x80\xa6,pNp2,p3,\xe2\x80\xa6,pN, where pipi denotes the parent of vertex ii.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 space-separated integers; for each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x921), the ii-th of these integers should denote the minimum capacity of the boat after adding vertex i+1i+1.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41062\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4pi<i1\xe2\x89\xa4pi<i for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN for all test cases does not exceed 106106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (29 points): the sum of NN for all test cases does not exceed 1,0001,000\nSubtask #2 (12 points): the diameter of the tree is less than 4040\nSubtask #3 (33 points): the sum of NN for all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105\nSubtask #4 (26 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n7\n1 1 2 2 3 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2 2 3 3 3 4\n\n\nExplanation\nAfter vertex 22 is added, we have two animals which do not get along with each other. If the boat has capacity 22, Chef can transport one of these animals to the right bank, return to the left bank alone and transport the other animal with him to the right bank too.\nAfter vertex 33 is added, we have three animals; neither of animals 22 and 33 can be left at a riverbank with animal 11. The boat needs to have capacity at least 22. With capacity 22, one possible strategy for Chef is as follows: First, transport animal 11 to the right bank and leave it there. Then, go back to the left bank, pick up animal 33 and transport it to the right bank; take animal 11 from the right bank, bring it to the left bank, take animal 22 from the left bank and bring it to the right bank. Finally, pick up animal 11 from the left bank and bring it to the right bank, so at the end, Chef and all animals are at the right bank.\nAfter vertex 44 is added, the boat needs to have capacity at least 33. One possible strategy is as follows: transport animals 22 and 33 to the right bank, return to the left bank and transport animals 11 and 44 to the right bank as well.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85bciobanu\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RIVER\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 aug18, bciobanu, bciobanu, hard, likecs, link-cut-tree, matrix-multiplication, tropical-geometry\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2922\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-07-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
