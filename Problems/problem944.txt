b"\n\n\nChef has N subordinates. In order to complete a very important order he will choose exactly K of them. He can't choose less than K since it will be not enough to complete the order in time. On the other hand if he chooses more than K subordinates he can't control them during the operation. Help him to find the number of ways he can choose the team to complete this very important order.\n\nInput\n The first line contains a single positive integer T <= 100, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains two integers N and K, where 0 <= N, K < 2^64. It is guaranteed that the answer will be less than 2^64.\n\nOutput\n For each test case, output a single line containing the number of ways to choose the required team.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 1\n3 3\n10 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n252\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85anton_adm\n\n\nTester:\nfriggstad\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFTEAM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Combinatorics\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1884\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-01-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.378571 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
