b"\nThe most dangerous cyborg Jenish is finally entrapped on a narrow bridge over a valley. The bridge is NN meters long. For convenience, position ii represents a portion of bridge between whose left border is at distance i\xe2\x88\x921i\xe2\x88\x921 meters from left end and right border is at distance ii meters from left end. \nThere are NN batteries placed at positions 1,2...N1,2...N. The ithith one has energy a[i]a[i].\nThere are two tanks of strength XX at positions 00 and N+1N+1. Initially Jenish has 00 energy.\nFrom now at any second tt starting from 11, \nfirst, Jenish can select any battery placed at position ii such that (t\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x92t+1)(t\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x92t+1) and add a[i]a[i] to his energy (every battery can be used atmost once).\nThen both the tanks move one meter towards each other. If there are still any batteries present at positions where the tanks are heading, the battery gets destroyed. \nAt any moment if Jenish's total energy is greater than or equal to XX, he destroys both the tanks and he escapes the cops. If by the end of \xe2\x8c\x8a(n+1)2\xe2\x8c\x8bth\xe2\x8c\x8a(n+1)2\xe2\x8c\x8bth second, he can't destroy the tanks, he himself gets destroyed. Find out if he can escape.\nInput:\n\nThe first line consists of a single integer TT, the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space separated integers which represents NN and XX for that test case respectively.\nThe second line of each test case contains NN space separated integers, ithith of which represents a[i]a[i].\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print in a single line, YESYES if Jenish can escape or NONO if he gets destroyed.\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4109\n0\xe2\x89\xa4a[i]\xe2\x89\xa41060\xe2\x89\xa4a[i]\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\xce\xa3\xce\xa3 NN over all the test cases does not exceed 105105\n\nSample Input:\n3\n4 8\n5 1 4 2\n3 4\n3 1 2\n2 7\n5 5\n\nSample Output:\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\nExplanation\nFor test 11, in the 1st second, first Jenish will select battery at index 11 and then the tanks from either side will move one meter closer, thus destroying the battery at index 44.Then, in the next second, Jenish will select battery at index 33.Then,tanks will move one meter closer again to destroy the remaining battery at index 22.But now, Jenish has a total energy of 99 units which is more than enough to destroy the tanks.\nFor test 22, Jenish can use batteries at index 11 and 22 to get a total energy of 44 units.\nFor test 33, Jenish can use batteries at index 11 or 22 and get a maximum of 55 units of energy which is less than required. \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85hackcyborg\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BATTERY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Priority Queue\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Queues\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2468\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
