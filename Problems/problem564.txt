b'\nRead problems statements in mandarin chinese, russian and vietnamese as well.\n\nChang is a big fan of bitwise operations. As he was sitting in a boring lecture, he thought of a simple problem but had a tough time figuring out the solution. Help him to solve it. The problem is as follows.\n\n\nGiven a list of N non-negative integers, you perform the following operation on this list.\n\n\nSelect any subsequence of integers from the list and remove the elements of that subsequence. The cost incurred will be Bitwise OR of the elements.\n\n\n\nYour task is to remove all the integers from the list by applying the above operation as many times as you want. You want to incur the minimum total cost at the end. Total cost is the sum of all the costs incurred while removing subsequences.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of the each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of integers in the list.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the integers in the given list.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output answer in a separate line.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nExplanation\n\nExample case 1.\nWe can first remove 1 from the list and then 2. Thus, the total cost comes out to 3.\n The other possible way is to choose the subsequence 1, 2, and remove it. The Bitwise OR of 1 and 2 is 3. So the cost incurred will be 3 in this case too.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85prateekg603\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHNGOR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bitwise Operation, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Bit Manipulation, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-06-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
