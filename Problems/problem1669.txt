b'\nA Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv likes lucky strings, i.e., the strings that consist only of the lucky digits 4 and 7.\n The Little Elephant has N favorite strings S1, S2, ..., SN and the favorite number K. Each character in Si (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N) is either the lucky digit (4 or 7) or the question mark ?.\nConsider some non-decreasing lucky string S. In other words, S has one of the following forms: 444...444, 777...777, 444...444777...777. The string S is called a  CNS (plural form is CNSes) if we can replace some (possibly zero) number of question marks with the lucky digits in each of the string S1, S2, ..., SN in a such way that the total number of replacements for all strings does not exceed K and S is a subsequence of each of the strings derived after the replacement.\nThe Little Elephant wants to know the total number of all different non-empty CNSes. Help him to find this number.\n\nNotes.\n\nLet S be some string (possibly not lucky). Then\n\n\n|S| denotes the length of the string S;\n\nS[i] (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 |S|) denotes the ith character of S (the numeration of characters starts from 1);\n\n\n\nThe string T is called a subsequence of the string S if T can be derived from S by deleting some (possibly zero) number of characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. For example, T = 474 is a subsequence of S = 74477747?? since after deleting characters at positions 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 from S we obtain T. Note that, the empty string and the string S itself are always the subsequences of S.\nInput\nThe first line of the input file contains two space separated integers N and K, the number of strings in the set and the favorite number of the Little Elephant. Each of the following N lines contains one favorite string of the Little Elephant. Namely, ith line among these N lines contains the string Si.\n\nOutput\n For each test case output a single line containing the answer for this test case.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 7474\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 109\nSi is non-empty for 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N.\n|S1| + |S2| + ... + |SN| \xe2\x89\xa4 100000. In other words, the total length of all N strings does not exceed 100000.\n Each character in Si (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N) is either the lucky digit (4 or 7) or the question mark ?.\nExample\nInput:\n3 2\n4447\n47???74\n4?77?\n\nOutput:\n5\n\n\nExplanation\nFor the sample input all different CNSes are 4, 7, 44, 47 and 447. Note, that 444 is not a CNS since it requires at least 3 replacements of the question marks.\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85witaliy_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85anton_lunyov\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LUCKYCOM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Segment Trees, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2929\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-03-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.3 - 0.386276 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
