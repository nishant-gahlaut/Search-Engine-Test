b"\n\xc2\xa0\nConvex Hull of a set of points, in 2D plane, is a convex polygon with minimum area such that each point lies either on the boundary of polygon or inside it.\n\nLet's consider a 2D plane, where we plug pegs at the points mentioned. We enclose all the pegs with a elastic band and then release it to take its shape. The closed structure formed by elastic band is similar to that of convex hull.\n\nIn the above figure, convex hull of the points, represented as dots, is the polygon formed by blue line.Given a set of N points, Find the perimeter of the convex hull for the points.\n\nInput\nFirst line of input will contain a integer, N, number of points. Then follow N lines where each line contains the coordinate, (xi yi), of ith point..\nOutput\nPrint the perimeter of convex hull for the given set of points. Print the perimeter till 1 decimal value.\nConstraints\n3 <= N <= 10000 \n0 <= xi, yi <= 10000\nThere exists, at least, three points which are non-colinear. \nExample\nInput:\n6    \n1 1    \n2 5    \n3 3    \n5 3    \n3 2    \n2 2\n\nOutput:\n12.2\nExplanation\nFor the given set of points in sample input, the convex hull is formed by the triangle whose vertices are given by (1, 1), (2, 5), (5, 3). Here perimeter of the hull is 12.200792856.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85karan_arora2\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CF224\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 codefight, cofi1601, convex-hull, karan_arora2, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-03-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nJAVA, C, CPP14, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PAS fpc, NODEJS, GO, HASK, PERL, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, LISP clisp, ERL, CLPS, ICK, NICE, ICON, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
