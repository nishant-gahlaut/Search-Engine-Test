He started to arrange them on the coordinate plane such that the area of intersection is maximized. However, he never rotated the rectangles he had, he only moved them here and there.\nAbhijeet soon realized that the game was boring and decided to introduce a modification. He decided to remove atmost M of those rectangles and arrange others on coordinate plane such that the area of intersection is maximized.\nGiven the dimensions of N rectangles and M, can you answer maximum possible area of intersection with above rules?\nNote: If all the rectangles are removed, the area of intersection is considered as 0.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.First line of each test case has two integer N and M. N lines follow, each has two integers representing the length and breadth of the rectangle.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the required answer.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Rectangle Dimensions \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Sum of N over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1 1\n10 10\n2 0\n5 10\n5 5\n2 1\n1 1\n2 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n100\n25\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1\nAbhijeet has only one rectangle. He can remove it, but then the area will be 0. Optimal way is not to remove it. Area = 10 * 10 = 100\nExample case 2\nAbhijeet cannot remove any rectangles in this case. He can however, place them such that the smaller 5 by 5 rectangle is completely inside the larger 5 by 10 rectangle. Then the area of intersection is 5 * 5 = 25\nExample case 3\nAbhijeet can remove atmost 1 rectangles in this case. He can remove the smaller rectangle of size 1 by 1. He is then left with 2 by 2 rectangle of area 4.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85anudeep2011\n\n\nTester:\n5\xe2\x98\x85xiaodao\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ANUAHR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Fenwick Trees, Binary Search on Answer\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Algorithms, Searching, Binary Search\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-01-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
