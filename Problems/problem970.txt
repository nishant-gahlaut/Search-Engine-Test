b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nYou have a rectangular grid of size N \xc3\x97 M, namely, there are cells (x, y) for 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 x \xe2\x89\xa4 N, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 y \xe2\x89\xa4 M. Two cells are adjacent if they share a side. More formally, two cells (x1, y1), (x2, y2) are adjacent if |x1 \xe2\x88\x92 x2| + |y1 \xe2\x88\x92 y2| = 1. Between two adjacent cells there can be a wall. Two cells a and b are connected if there is a way between them (in other words there is a sequence of cells c1, c2, ..., ck that c1 = a, ck = b, and for each 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i < k, ci, ci+1 are adjacent cells without wall between them).\nNow you are given Q queries, each of whom is of following four types.\n\n1 x y - build the wall between cells (x, y) and (x, y+1). If there is already exist a wall between them, this query is ignored.\n2 x y - build the wall between cells (x, y) and (x+1, y). If there is already exist a wall between them, this query is ignored.\n3 x1 y1 x2 y2 - check if cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are connected. You must answer 1 if they are connected, 0 otherwise.\n4 - You must answer the size of the largest connected component. A connected component is a set of sells wherein each two cells are connected. The size of a connected component is a number of the cells in it.\n\nYou must assume that there are no walls on the grid before the queries.\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases are follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and Q, denoting the grid sizes and amount of queries. For next Q lines, each line contains a query. The format of queries are the same as described by the statement.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output an integer, denoting the sum of answers for queries of type 3 and 4. Note that you just print only the sum of the answers for each test case.\nConstraints and Subtasks\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\nThe sum of Q over all test cases in one test file does not exceed 106\nFor queries of type 1: 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 x \xe2\x89\xa4 N and 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 y \xe2\x89\xa4 M\xe2\x88\x921\nFor queries of type 2: 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 x \xe2\x89\xa4 N\xe2\x88\x921 and 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 y \xe2\x89\xa4 M\nFor queries of type 3: 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 x1, x2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N and 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 y1, y2 \xe2\x89\xa4 M\n\nSubtask 1: (15 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xc3\x97 N \xc3\x97 M \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n\nSubtask 2: (15 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 300\nThe sum of Q over all test cases in one test file does not exceed 105\n\nSubtask 3: (70 points)\n\nNo additional constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3 4 10\n3 1 1 3 4\n1 1 2\n1 2 2\n2 2 2\n4\n1 3 1\n4\n3 1 1 3 4\n1 1 2\n3 1 1 1 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\nExplanation\nQuery 1. There are a lot of ways from (1,1) to (3,4). One of them is marked in red in the picture #1. So these are connected, then Answer = 1 in this query.\nQuery 2. In the picture #2 you can see the grid after second query. \nQuery 3. In the picture #3 you can see the grid after third query. \nQuery 4. In the picture #4 you can see the grid after fourth query.\nQuery 5. In the picture #5 the largest connected component marked in green. Thus Answer = 12.\nQuery 6. In the picture #6 you can see the grid after sixth query.\nQuery 7. In the picture #7 the largest connected component marked in green. Thus Answer = 7.\nQuery 8. As you can see in the picture #8, there are no ways from (1,1) to (3,4). So they are no longer connected, then Answer = 0.\nQuery 9. In the picture #9 you can see the grid after ninth query. There is no difference between it and the grid after the sixth query, because before the ninth query the wall was already built.\nQuery 10. When a = b, two cells a and b are always connected. Thus Answer = 1.\nTherefore, the sum of the answers is 1 + 12 + 7 + 0 + 1 = 21, which you should print.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85antoniuk1\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85laycurse\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MTRWY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 2D Arrays, Disjoint Set Union, Connected Components, Offline Queries\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos, Algorithms, Queries\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2301\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-01-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
