b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are playing a game of balls on a grid of dimensions n * m. All except one cell in this grid contains a ball each, i.e. exactly one of the cells is empty, and the others contain exactly 1 ball. You are allowed to make one of the following two kind of moves one by one in any order:\n\n\nChoose two adjacent cells one containing a ball and other being empty. Move the ball to the empty cell. Two cells are said to be adjacent to each other if they share a side with each other.\nChoose three consecutive cells (either horizontal or vertical), in which the middle cell has a ball, one of the other cells has a ball and the remaining one is empty. You can move the ball from the non-empty non-middle cell to the empty cell, and destroy the ball in the middle cell while jumping over it, thus making middle cell empty too.\n\n\nYou are asked to play this game. At the end of the game, you win if there is exactly one cell containing a ball. You can make at max 5000 moves per testcase. Find any possible sequence of moves to win this game. If this is impossible to achieve, print -1.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space separated integers, n, m which are the dimensions of the grid.\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m characters. denoting the i-th row of the grid. The character '.' denotes that cell is empty, whereas '*' denotes that the cell has a ball in it.\nOutput\nFor each test case, the first line should contain an integer X which will denote the number of moves you want to make. If it is impossible to achieve the desired objective, this integer should be -1. This number X should be at most 5000.\nIf it is possible to achieve the objective, then each of the next X lines should contain four space separated integers: x1, y1, x2, y2 which signifies the following.\nIf you are making the first type of move, then you are moving the ball from the cell (x1, y1) to (x2, y2).\nIn the second type of move, it will denote that the non-middle cell with ball is (x1, y1) and the empty cell is (x2, y2).\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n, m \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n\nExample\nInput\n1\n2 3\n***\n**.\n\nOutput\n8\n2 1 2 3\n1 1 2 1\n1 3 1 1\n2 1 2 2\n2 3 2 1\n2 1 2 2\n2 2 1 2\n1 1 1 3\n\nExplanation\n\n***\n**.\n\n\n\nIn first move, you can take the ball at (2, 1) and move it to cell (2, 3), and the ball at cell (2, 2) will be destroyed.
