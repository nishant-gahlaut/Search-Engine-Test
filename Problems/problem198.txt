b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given two binary strings SS and PP, each with length NN. A binary string contains only characters \'0\' and \'1\'. For each valid ii, let\'s denote the ii-th character of SS by SiSi.\nYou have to convert the string SS into PP using zero or more operations. In one operation, you should choose two indices ii and jj (1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4N) such that SiSi is \'1\' and SjSj is \'0\', and swap SiSi with SjSj.\nDetermine if it is possible to convert SS into PP by performing some operations.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains a single string SS.\nThe third line contains a single string PP.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "Yes" if it is possible to convert SS into PP or "No" otherwise (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nSS and PP contain only characters \'0\' and \'1\'\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 105105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa414N\xe2\x89\xa414\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 100100\n\nSubtask #2 (30 points): the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 1,0001,000\nSubtask #3 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2\n00\n00\n3\n101\n010\n4\n0110\n0011\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYes\nNo\nYes\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The strings are already equal.\nExample case 2: It can be showed that it is impossible to convert SS into PP.\nExample case 3: You can swap S2S2 with S4S4.
