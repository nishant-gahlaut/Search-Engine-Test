b'\nJojo lives in a 2-dimensional Universe which has NN disconnected villages numbered from 1 to N serially. He strongly believes in the Parallel Universe theory and spent years of life finding a way to contact other Parallel Universes. He assumes that the Parallel Universe will also contain\nN villages as his original universe. He devises a way to construct an undirectional path to connect the ith numbered village in the original universe to the ith numbered village of the parallel universe, for all i between 1 and N. But his assumption was wrong, the Parallel Universe does\ncontain N villages but  A1 is the first village,A2 is the second and so on for the array A.\nThe ith village of the original universe is connected to the i numbered village in the parallel universe. Since the Universe is 2-dimensional, the path between these two universes may intersect. Such interaction of the paths will cause a Universal vortex which will change the course of life for the people in both universes. Jojo needs to correct this flaw by a path separation machine which would project the path to 3rd dimension in order to prevent them from intersecting. The path separation machine needs 2 unit of fuel to separate two intersected paths(i.e. 1 intersection point) and it cost X rupees for one unit of the fuel. Help Jojo to know how much he needs to pay for the fuel. \nNote: One has to count individual intersection points\nInput:\n\nFirst-line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \nFirst-line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, N (number of villages in both universes) and X (cost of one unit of fuel).\nSecond-line contains N space-separated integers Ai (Arrangement of villages in Parallel Universe)\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output the total cost of the fule for separating each intersection.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N,X\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nSample Input:\n2\n5 1\n1 2 5 4 3\n6 1\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nSample Output:\n6\n0\n\nExplanation:\nCase 1:\n    Original       Parallel\n    Universe       Universe\n       (1)-----------(1)\n       (2)-----------(2)\n       (3)           (5)\n         \\           /  \n          \\         /\n      (4)--X-------X----(4)\n            \\     /\n             \\   /\n              \\ /\n               X\n              / \\\n             /   \\\n            /     \\\n           /       \\\n          /         \\\n       (5)           (3)\n\nHere there are 3 intersection point (1 between (4,4) and (3,3), 1 between (4,4) and (5,5) and 1 between (3,3) and (5,5))\nHence ans= 2*3*X\n\n\nCase 2:\n    Original          Parallel\n    Universe          Universe\n       (1)--------------(1)\n       (2)--------------(2)\n       (3)--------------(3)\n       (4)--------------(4)\n       (5)--------------(5)\n       (6)--------------(6)\n\n\nHere there are 0 intersection point\nHence ans= 2*0*X\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85akay_99\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ENCDEC8\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 akay_99, divide-and-conquer, ende2020, fenwick-tree, inversions, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
