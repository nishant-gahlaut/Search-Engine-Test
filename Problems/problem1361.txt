b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given two arrays A and B, each  consisting of N integers. \nYou are also given M queries of the form Lj Rj Cj Dj. For each of these queries, we ask you to calculate the value of the sum of max{0, Ai \xc3\x97 Cj - Bi \xc3\x97 Dj} over i from Lj to Rj.\nThis is an on-line problem, so you won't get the next query unless you answer the current one.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the length of the arrays A and B.\nThe second line contains N space-separeted integer numbers, denoting the array A.\nThe third line contains N space-separated integer numbers, denoting the array B.\nThe fourth line contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries.\nEach of the following Q lines will contain four space-separated integer numbers Lj Rj Cj Dj denoting the query.\nThis is an interactive problem. That means that you won't be able to read Lj Rj Cj Dj before you've answered the previous query. Please flush output buffer after you've output the answer to each query. In C++ it can be done with fflush(stdout) routine.\nOutput\nFor each query, output the answer on a separate line. Please flush standard output after answering each query.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, Q \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai, Bi \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Lj \xe2\x89\xa4 Rj \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Cj, Dj \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n\nExample\nInput:\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n5 4 3 2 1\n3\n1 5 1 1\n1 5 1 2\n1 5 2 1\n\nOutput:\n6\n3\n18\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. If we write out max{0, Ai \xc3\x97 Cj - Bi \xc3\x97 Dj}, we will get the following:\n\nIn the first query: {0, 0, 0, 2, 4}. The sum is 6.\nIn the second query: {0, 0, 0, 0, 3}. The sum is 3.\nIn the third query: {0, 0, 3, 6, 9}. The sum is 18.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsergey_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SEGSUMQ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cross-product, medium, segment-tree, sergey_adm, snckel16\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-05-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
