b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nYou are given a Cartesian plane, and you are asked to support the following three kinds of operations:\n\nI x1 y1 x2 y2: add an axes-parallel rectangle on the plane. The bottom-left corner has coordinates (x1, y1), the top-right one has coordinates (x2, y2) \nD index: remove the retangle that was added during the index-th addition operation\nQ x1 y1 x2 y2: output the number of rectangles on the plane that have the common area with the rectangle with a bottom-left corner coordinates (x1, y1) and a top-right corner coordinates (x2, y2).\nPlease notice that, even if the two rectangles only share a common point, they are still regarded as sharing common area\n\n\nAlso, there can be a few same rectangles on the plane, they should be regarded as a few different rectangles.\nThere are Q operations in all, can you fulfill them?\nInput\nThe first line contains an integer Q.\nThe next Q lines represent the operations you are to deal with. Each of them contains an operation in one of the three forms above.\nOutput\nFor each Q-type operation, output the result on the separate line of the output.\nConstraints\n\n1 <= Q\xc2\xa0<= 100000\n1 <= x1 <= x2 <= 109\n1 <= y1 <= y2 <= 109\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n5\nI 1 1 2 2\nI 2 2 3 3\nQ 3 3 4 4 \nD 2\nQ 3 3 4 4\n\nOutput:\n1\n0  \nExplanation\n\nIn the third operation, the rectangle (2, 2)-(3, 3) has a common point with the given rectangle.\nBut in the fifth operation, as the rectangle (2, 2)-(3, 3) has been removed, so there are no rectangles that has the common area with the given rectangle.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85xiaodao\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/QRECT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Square Root Decomposition\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2789\n\n\nDate Added:\n3-07-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
