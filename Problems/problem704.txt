b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a rooted tree with NN nodes (numbered 1 through N); node 1 is the root. For each valid i, the i-th node has a value vi and another parameter mi.\nA leaf is a node without sons. Let's denote the number of leaf nodes in the tree by L and their numbers by l1,l2,\xe2\x80\xa6,lL, in increasing order. Then, for each valid i, let's define the answer for the leaf li in the following way:\n\nConsider the path from the root to li. For each node on this path (including the root and this leaf), choose a non-negative integer and multiply the value of this node by it.\nSum up the resulting values of all nodes on this path.\nThe answer ai for this leaf is defined as the maximum possible remainder of this sum modulo mli.\n\nFind the answers for all leaves.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nEach of the following N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers x and y denoting that nodes x and y are connected by an edge.\nThe next line contains N space-separated integers v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vN.\nThe last line contains N space-separated integers m1,m2,\xe2\x80\xa6,mN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing L space-separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aL.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa48\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4vi\xe2\x89\xa41018 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4mi\xe2\x89\xa41018 for each valid i\nthe graph described on the input is a tree\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n1 2\n2 5\n1 3\n3 4\n2 3 4 6 7\n1 2 3 2 10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0 9\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: There are only two leaves, l1=4 and l2=5.
