b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\n\nChuru is working as a data scientist in Coderpur. He works on a lot of data on the daily basis. One day, he found an interesting problem, which was very easy to solve for small data but was getting more complex with increasing number of data points. So, Churu needs your help in solving this problem.\n\n Given a set S of N non-negative integers (Some integers might occur more than once in the set), find out the value of SETDIFF(S). \n\n\n\nWhere max(s) represents the maximum value in set s whereas min(s) represents the minimum value in the set s.\nAs value of  SETDIFF(S) can be very large, print it modulo  (109 + 7) . \n\n\nThere might be repeated values in the set. For set S = {1,2,2}, consider that first 2 is not same as the second 2 and there will be two different subsets {1,2}. See last sample case for the more clarifications. \n\nInput\n\nFirst line of input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases.  \nFor each test case, first line will contain an integer N denoting number of elements in set S.  \n Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the set S. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single integer representing the answer of that test case.\n\nNote\n\nTwo subsets will be called different if there exists an index i such that S[i] occurs in one of the subset and not in another.\n\nConstraints\n\nSubtask #1: 20 points\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T  \xe2\x89\xa4 5, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N  \xe2\x89\xa4 1000,  0 \xe2\x89\xa4 value in set \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\n\n\nSubtask #2: 25 points\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T  \xe2\x89\xa4 5, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N  \xe2\x89\xa4 105,  0 \xe2\x89\xa4 value in set \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n\n\n\nSubtask #3: 55 points\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T  \xe2\x89\xa4 5, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N  \xe2\x89\xa4 105,  0 \xe2\x89\xa4 value in set \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n2\n1 2\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n1 2 3 4\n3\n1 2 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n6 \n23\n3\n\n\nExplanation\n\nFor first case answer will be 2-1 = 1.\n\n\nFor the second case:\nSubset = {1}, max(s)-min(s) = 0.\nSubset = {2}, max(s)-min(s) = 0.\nSubset = {3}, max(s)-min(s) = 0.\nSubset = {1,2}, max(s)-min(s) = 1.\nSubset = {2,3}, max(s)-min(s) = 1.\nSubset = {1,3}, max(s)-min(s) = 2.\nSubset = {1,2,3}, max(s)-min(s) = 2.\nSo the output will be 1+1+2+2 = 6.\n\n\nIn the last case, there are three subsets, {1,2}, {1,2} and {1,2,2} having max(s) - min(s) = 1 for each.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85amitpandeykgp\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85kevinsogo\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SETDIFF\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Modular Exponentiation, Combinatorics\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Modular Arithmetic\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1729\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-02-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
