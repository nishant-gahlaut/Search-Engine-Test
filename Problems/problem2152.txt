b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a rectangular table consisting of N rows and M columns. Rows are numbered by integers from 1 to N from top to bottom and columns are numbered from 1 to M from left to right. Let (x, y) denote the cell corresponding to xth row and yth column.\nChef has two bunnies, both initially at the cell (1, 1). He wants them to get to the cell (N, M). Each of the bunny can move from some cell (x, y) to cell (x+1, y) or cell (x, y+1). As bunnies do not really like each other, they do not want to meet along their ways, except at the start (1,1) and end (N, M) cells.\n\nAlso, there are exactly C cells in the table containing a carrot. When a bunny goes through such a cell, he eats this carrot. As Chef also wants to eat carrots, he wants that both the bunnies cumulatively don't eat more than D carrots.\n\nFind out number of ways in which bunnies can get from cell (1, 1) to cell (N, M) satisfying the above conditions. As answer could be large, please output your answer modulo MOD.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains five space-separated integers N, M, C, D and MOD denoting the sizes of table, the number of cells with a carrot, the maximum number of carrots that can be eaten by bunnies and the modulo.\nEach of next C lines contains two space-separated integers xi and yi denoting the coordinates of the cell with a carrot. \n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the numbers of ways bunnies can get from cell (1,1) to cell (N, M) modulo MOD.\n\nConstraints\n\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 D \xe2\x89\xa4 C \xe2\x89\xa4 min{200, N *  M - 2}\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 xi \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 yi \xe2\x89\xa4 M\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 MOD \xe2\x89\xa4 109\nIt's guaranteed that there is no carrot in cells (1, 1) and (N, M)\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (7 pts)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 5\nTL = 2s\n\n \nSubtask #2 (11 pts)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M, C \xe2\x89\xa4 60\nTL = 2s\n\n \nSubtask #3 (13 pts)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\nC = 0\nTL = 2s\n\n \nSubtask #4 (19 pts)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 C \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nTL = 10s\n\n \nSubtask #5 (23 pts)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 C \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nTL = 2s\n\n \nSubtask #6 (27 pts)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5\nTL = 2s\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n2 3 0 0 10\n2 3 1 0 16\n2 1\n3 3 1 0 7\n2 2\n2 2 2 1 11\n1 2\n2 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.\n***\n***\nIn this case there is only one variant how bunnies can get from the cell (1,1) to the cell (2, 3). \nFirst bunny - (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (2. 3) and the second bunny - (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3).\n\nExample case 2.\n***\nx**\nIn this example there are no two nonintersecting ways without cells with carrot. Therefore the answer is 0.\nExample case 4.\n*x\nx*\nIn this case there is only one variant how bunnies can move. First bunny - (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) and the second bunny - (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2). But in this case, in total, bunnies will eat two carrots(when only one carrot is allowed). Therefore the answer is 0.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85antoniuk1\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHNBGMT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Extended Euclid's Algorithm, Chinese Remainder Theorem, Modulo Multiplicative Inverse, Binomial Theorem\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Modular Arithmetic, Algebra, GCD, Euclid's Algorithm\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3101\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-02-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 - 10 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
