b'\nHarry is a busy person the fact that in his world, each week has 10 days does not help him much.\nHe has been assigned work for N consecutive weeks.\nHe created set S of schedules for the N weeks.\nA schedule is a set of days on which he has to work for each week. Formally, schedule\xe2\x8a\x86{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}.\nHelp harry find a non empty schedule K such that the set S\xe2\x80\xb2={F(X,K)\xe2\x88\x80X\xe2\x88\x88S} is the same as S.\nNote:\n\nF(X,K)=(X\xe2\x88\xaaK)\xe2\x88\x92(X\xe2\x88\xa9K).\nX\xe2\x88\xaaY is the union operation on sets. {1,2}\xe2\x88\xaa{2,3}={1,2,3} not {1,2,2,3}\nX\xe2\x88\xa9Y is the intersection operation on sets. {1,2}\xe2\x88\xa9{2,3}={2}\nX\xe2\x88\x92Y is the set subtraction operation on sets. {1,2}\xe2\x88\x92{2,3}=1 i.e. we remove elements from X that are also present in Y\nS or S\xe2\x80\xb2 are NOT multisets i.e. they do not contain duplicate elements.\n\nExample: for S={{1,2,3},{5,6,7},{1,5,6}} and K={1,3}, S\xe2\x80\xb2={{2},{1,3,5,6,7},{3,5,6}}\nIf multiple solutions exist, you may print any of them.\nFor example: for S={{1},{},{2},{1,2}}, K can be {1}or{2}or{1,2}\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nFirst line of each test case contains a single integer N, denoting the number of weeks he has to work. 2N lines follow describing the schedule for each week in two lines\nAn integer X denoting the size of the schedule.\nX space-separated integers d1,d2,d3,\xe2\x80\xa6dX denoting the days he has to work for that week.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each test case print -1 in a newline if no such schedule exists.\nOtherwise, print two lines.\nFirst-line will contain the size of K\nSecond-line will contain the space-separated elements of K\n\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa46000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41024\n0\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4di\xe2\x89\xa410\n\nSample Input:\n1\n6\n2\n3 4\n2\n1 2\n1\n4\n3\n2 3 4\n3\n1 2 3\n2\n2 4\n\nSample Output:\n1\n3\n\nExplanation:\nWe have: S={{3,4},{1,2},{4},{2,3,4},{1,2,3},{2,4}}\nIf K={3} then, S\xe2\x80\xb2={{4},{1,2,3},{3,4},{2,4},{1,2},{2,3,4}}\nNotice that the order of elements does not matter.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85lakshch21\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/D2C108\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 bitset, d2co2020, lakshch21, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
