b'\nGenthru has observed that all the NN cities on greed island have good trade relations with each other. He deduces that the reason for this is that there exists a route between any pair of cities on greed island. Being a villain he wants to sever the trade relation between at least one pair of cities, so he decides to destroy exactly 1 road among the existing M roads. You have to determine the exact number of roads that Genthru could destroy such that it results in there being no route between at least 1 pair of cities.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nNext line contains the number of cities N and the number of roads M.\nNext M lines contain 2 integers ai and bi indicating that there exists a road between ai and bi.
