Let's call such a sequence of commands a path configuration for a pair of nodes (u,v)(u,v).\nYou are asked to process a series of the following queries: \nYou are given three integers nn, uu and vv (1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n). Count the pairs of nodes (w,t)(w,t) (1\xe2\x89\xa4w,t\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4w,t\xe2\x89\xa4n) such that the path configuration for (w,t)(w,t) is the same with the path configuration for (u,v)(u,v).\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer QQ, denoting the number of queries to process.\nEach of the next QQ lines contains three space-separated integers nn, uu and vv denoting a query.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print the answer on a separate line.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851041\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n11 9 11\n10 2 2\n8 1 8\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n10\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the first query from the example test case, you should count pairs (5,7)(5,7) and (9,11)(9,11).\nIn the second query from the example test case, you should count the following pairs: (1,1)(1,1), (2,2)(2,2), (3,3)(3,3), (4,4)(4,4), (5,5)(5,5), (6,6)(6,6), (7,7)(7,7), (8,8)(8,8), (9,9)(9,9) and (10,10)(10,10).\nIn the third query from the example test case, you should only count a pair (1,8)(1,8).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kostya_by\n\n\nTester:\n4\xe2\x98\x85pavel1996\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BINTREEQ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Binary Tree, Basic Maths, Lowest Common Ancestor, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Tree Data Structure, Mathematics, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2187\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-03-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
