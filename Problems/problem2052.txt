b"\nThe chef may be losing his mind.  He has demanded you solve the following task: \ngiven an integer P, find the smallest positive integer whose product of digits, modulo 1000000007, is P.\nYou can't imagine what this has to do with cooking, but you'd better do what he says or you won't get to sample his culinary delights.\n\nInput:\nInput will begin with a positive integer T<=15, the number of test cases.\nT lines follow, each containing an integer P between 0 and 1000000006, inclusive.\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print on a single line the smallest positive integer whose product of digits, modulo 1000000007, is P.\nIt is guaranteed that such an integer exists with fewer than 700 digits.\nSample input:\n4\n16\n486\n220703118\n0\nSample output:\n28\n699\n5555555555555\n10\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndavid_adm\n\n\nTester:\nMaksflow\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DIGITS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Number Theory, Greedy, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-09-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2.48684 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
