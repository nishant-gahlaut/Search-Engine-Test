b"\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nChef wants to buy candy for his friend. He went to a store which sells candies from $N$ jars, arranged in a circle and numbered $1$ through $N$ in such a way that for each valid $i$, jars $i$ and $i+1$ are adjacent, and jars $1$ and $N$ are also adjacent. For each valid $i$, the candies in the $i$-th jar have a sweetness $A_i$.\nObviously, Chef wants to buy the sweetest candies. However, he gets attracted by a limited-time offer in the store and wants to use it. The offer is as follows: Chef has to choose an integer $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le N$), then choose $k$ jars which are contiguous in the circle, and finally, he can buy the candies from these jars at a discounted price. For a fixed $k$, Chef chooses the $k$ contiguous jars uniformly randomly (among all possible sets of $k$ contiguous jars), but once he chooses them, he buys only candies with the largest sweetness among the chosen jars.\nAs you may have guessed, Chef is confused about which value of $k$ to choose. For each valid $k$, let's denote the expected value of the sweetness of the candies he will buy if he chooses this value of $k$ by $S_k$. Then, let's denote $F_k = S_k \\cdot N$; it can be proved that for each valid $k$, $F_k$ is an integer. Can you help Chef find the values of $F_1, F_2, \\ldots, F_N$?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.\nThe second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing $N$ space-separated integers $F_1, F_2, \\ldots, F_N$.\nConstraints\n\n$1 \\le T \\le 10$\n$1 \\le N \\le 10^6$\n$1 \\le A_i \\le 10^9$ for each valid $i$\nthe sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4\n1 2 3 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n10 13 15 16\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85teja349\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SUBMAXA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Difference Arrays, Expected Value, Prefix Sum, Cyclic Rotation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Mathematics, Probability, Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2668\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-02-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
