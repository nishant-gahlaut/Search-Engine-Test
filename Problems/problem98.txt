This algorithm finds all maximal substrings which contains only one character repeated one or more times (a substring is maximal if it we cannot add one character to its left or right without breaking this property) and replaces each such substring by the string "cK", where KK is the length of the substring and cc is the only character it contains. For example, "aabaaa" is compressed to "a2b1a3".\nSaeed wanted to check if the students understood the algorithm, so he wrote a string SS on the board and asked the students if the algorithm is effective on SS, i.e. if the string created by compressing SS is strictly shorter than SS. Help them answer this question.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string SS.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if the algorithm is effective on SS or "NO" if it is not.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4|S|\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4|S|\xe2\x89\xa4103\nSS may consist of only lowercase English letters.\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\nbbbbbbbbbbaa\nc\naaaaaaaaaabcdefgh\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nNO\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n\nThe compressed string of "bbbbbbbbbbaa" is "b10a2", which is shorter.\nThe compressed string of "c" is "c1", which is not shorter than "c".\nThe compressed string of "aaaaaaaaaabcdefgh" is "a10b1c1d1e1f1g1h1", which is not shorter than "aaaaaaaaaabcdefgh" (both strings have length 1717).\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85i_love_islam\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEALG\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Loops, Brute Force, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Basic Programming Concepts, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1273\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-12-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
