b"\nYou are given a tree with nn vertices numbered 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n. There are two players Alice and Bob who play a game on this tree, taking turns alternatively.  Alice starts.\nIn their turn a participant has to remove a leaf (and the edge adjacent to it) from the tree. A leaf is a node with degree 1. Please note, that the tree changes with the game progressing, and a node which is not a leaf in the beginning can become a leaf later and become eligible to be removed.\nAlice likes the vertex x and wants it be the last node remaining. Bob hates node x and doesn't want it to be the last node remaining.\nFor all the choices of vertex x, find who wins assuming both play optimally.\nInput\nThere are multiple independent testcases.\n\nThe first line contains T, the number of testcases.\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single interger n, the number of vertices.\nEach of the next n\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two integers denoting the endpoints of an edge. Each edge is present only once.\n\nOutput\nFor each testcase, print a string of length n on a new line. The ith character in this string should be 1 if Alice wins the game for x=i, and 0 if Bob wins.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 105.\n\nExample Input\n2\n2\n1 2\n5\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n3 5\n\nExample Output\n11\n00000\n\nExplanation\nIn the first testcase. If x=1, Alice removes node 2 and wins. If x=2, Alice removes node 1 and wins.\nIn the second testcase, consider x=1. If Alice removes node 2, Bob can remove node 1 in his turn and win. If Alice removes node 4, Bob then removes node 2. Then in her turn, Alice can only remove node 5 leaving two nodes 1 and 3. Bob can now remove node 1 and win. The game proceeds similarly if Alice removes node 5 first. So, Bob wins the game.\nOne can see that for other choices of x as well, Bob wins.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85jtnydv25\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TRGAME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Mathematics, DFS, Game Theory\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-12-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
