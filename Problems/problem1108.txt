b'\nThe Siruseri Welfare Association has organized a Cultural Programme for families in the area, to build up community spirit. The Cultural Programme is being held at the Siruseri Community Hall. Inside the hall, children perform songs and dances. Outside, local restaurants have set up stalls selling snacks.\nAs is typical on such an occasion, members of the audience drift in and out of the hall during the program. An observant office-bearer of the Siruseri Welfare Association notes down the times at which people enter and leave the hall. Let us assume the total observations taken by the office bearer to be NN.He wants to know the maximum size of the audience that was present at the same time during the course of the program.\nFor convenience, he writes down each time as a single integer - the number of minutes that have passed from the start of the program. Also, the door of the hall is narrow, so at any time, either one person can enter or one person can leave the hall, but not both. Thus, each entry and exit time that is noted down is distinct.\nLet us consider the sample test case, each line denotes the entry time and exit time of one person. (The identity of the person is not important\xe2\x80\x94the same person may enter and leave the hall many times. For instance, in the example below, it might well be that the entries and exits recorded at Serial Nos 2 and 5 refer to the same person.)\nYour task is to read the list of entry and exit times and compute the maximum size of the audience during the program.\nInput Format\nThe first line of input is a single integer, NN, the number of entries and exits recorded. This is followed by NN lines of input. Each of these lines consists of two integers, separated by a space, describing one entry and exit. The first integer is the entry time and the second integer is the exit time.\nOutput Format\nA single integer, denoting the maximum size of the audience at any point during the performance.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa41\xe2\x89\xa4 The entry and exit times for each person \xe2\x89\xa4107.\xe2\x89\xa4107.\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (70 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa450001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45000\nSubtask 2 (30 points): Orignal Constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n1 7\n2 4\n6 9\n3 8 \n5 10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nThis was achieved between times 6 and 7.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85yogesh01\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Frequency Arrays, Hashmaps\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-11-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
