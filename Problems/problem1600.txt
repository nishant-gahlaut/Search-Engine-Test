b'\nA wooden Fence is made up of woodenplankswoodenplanks each having width of 1 meter, but varying heights (in meters). Suppose there are N  wooden planks of varying heights .  A rabbit named Harry wants to cross the wooden fence. In order to make this possible you have to cut a Rectangular or a Square section of the wooden fence. Find out the maximum area that can be cut to allow Harry to pass through the wooden fence.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains two line of input.\nFirst line contains N,the number of wooden fence.\nSecond line contains  N space separated integers, A1,A2\xe2\x80\xa6AN, where Ai denotes the    height of the ith wooden plank.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the maximum area in meter square  that would be cut of the wooden plank.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa4104\n\nSample Input:\n2\n6\n2 1 5 6 2 3\n5\n2 4 6 3 5  \nSample Output:\n10\n12  \nEXPLANATION:\nCase\xc2\xa0#1 :\n\n\nMaximum area of wooden planks comes when 3rd plank having height 5 meters along with its next plank with height 6 meters is cut. Remember that we have to cut only square or Rectangular area hence 4th plank having height 6 meters would be cut only 5 meters from ground.\nHence the answer is 10.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85maazbinasad3\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/WALL123\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 data-structure, maazbinasad3, medium, stack\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-03-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
