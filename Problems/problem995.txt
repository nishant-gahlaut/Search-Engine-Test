Node 11 is the root and each edge is either white or black. The shape of the tree is as follows:\n\nLet's number the levels of the tree 00 through DD from top to bottom. Each node at an odd level is connected to its parent with a white edge (e.g. edges 1\xe2\x88\x9221\xe2\x88\x922 and 1\xe2\x88\x9231\xe2\x88\x923), while each node at an even level is connected to its parent with a black edge (e.g. edges 2\xe2\x88\x9242\xe2\x88\x924, 2\xe2\x88\x9252\xe2\x88\x925, 3\xe2\x88\x9263\xe2\x88\x926, 3\xe2\x88\x9273\xe2\x88\x927).\nChef's friend Alice wants to pick two distinct nodes uu and vv and a colour CC (white or black) uniformly randomly and add an edge between the nodes uu and vv with colour CC. It is allowed for two parallel edges to exist between nodes uu and vv after this operation.\nA strip is an alternating cycle of white and black edges. Each vertex may appear any number of times in a strip. Find the probability that a strip is created when Alice adds an edge to the graph. It can be proved that this probability can be expressed as a fraction PQPQ, where PP and QQ are positive integers and QQ is coprime with 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007. You should compute P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007, where Q\xe2\x88\x921Q\xe2\x88\x921 denotes the multiplicative inverse of QQ modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer DD.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007 (109+7109+7).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): D\xe2\x89\xa415D\xe2\x89\xa415\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n333333336\n142857144\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Alice picks one of the following pairs (u,v)(u,v): (1,2)(1,2), (1,3)(1,3), (2,3)(2,3), (2,1)(2,1), (3,1)(3,1) and (3,2)(3,2). She also picks a colour, but a strip can be created only if Alice picks the colour black and one of the pairs (1,2)(1,2), (2,1)(2,1), (1,3)(1,3) or (3,1)(3,1), so the probability is 4/12=1/34/12=1/3, which is 333,333,336333,333,336 modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85phoenix71\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/STRPTRE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Permutations & Combinations, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Combinatorics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-03-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
