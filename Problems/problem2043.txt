b"\nChef has prepared a large number of unique dishes for a fancy dinner.\nPatrons from all over the world are interested in purchasing tickets for the dinner.\nEach interested patron has specified 2 dishes that they are interested in eating for dinner.\nAs long as a patron is served at least one of their 2 preferred dishes, they will be happy.\nChef wants to sell as many tickets as possible while being able to guarantee that all patrons are happy.\nUnfortunately, Chef has no control over who buys the tickets, only how many will be sold.\nHow many tickets can Chef sell?\nInput\n\nInput will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases.\nEach test case begins with 2 integers N and M, \nthe number of dishes and number of patrons, respectively.\nM lines follow, each containing 2 distinct integers between 1 and N, inclusive.\nThe numbers on the i-th line represent the preferred dishes of the i-th patron.\nEach test case is followed by a blank line.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer indicating the maximum number of tickets\nChef can sell while still being able to guarantee that every patron will be happy no matter which patrons buy tickets.\nSample Input\n3\n6 4\n1 2\n1 2\n3 4\n5 6\n\n6 5\n1 2\n1 2\n1 2\n3 4\n5 6\n\n4 5\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 3\n3 4\n\nSample Output\n4\n2\n4\n\n\n\nIn the second example, Chef cannot sell 3 tickets because it's possible that 3 patrons will arrive all preferring dishes 1 or 2.\n\nConstraints\n\nT \xe2\x89\xa4 15\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 200\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 500\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndavid_adm\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85subra\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TICKETS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Shortest Paths, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Graph Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2640\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-03-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.45431 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
