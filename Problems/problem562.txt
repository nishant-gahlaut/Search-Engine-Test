b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef lives in a country that uses coins of NN denominations. For each valid i, one coin of denomination i is worth Di cents.\nA bus ticket, when bought from the driver, costs P cents and can be paid for only with coins. Moreover, to save time, bus drivers never give back any change.\nChef is wondering if it is possible that someone would have enough coins to buy a ticket, but would be forced to overpay for it (pay more than P cents), or if it is always possible to pay exactly P cents when it is possible to buy a ticket, regardless of the values of the coins the person buying the ticket has.\nIf it is possible to be forced to overpay, please find any such example \xe2\x80\x95 any multiset of coins such that in total, they are worth strictly more than P cents, but if any coin is removed from this multiset, the total worth of the remaining coins is strictly smaller than P.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and P.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers D1,D2,\xe2\x80\xa6,DN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nIf it is impossible for someone to be forced to overpay, print a single line containing the string "NO" (without quotes).\nOtherwise, print a single line containing the string "YES", followed by a space and N space-separated integers C1,C2,\xe2\x80\xa6,CN such that:\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nP<S=\xe2\x88\x91Ni=1Ci\xe2\x8b\x85Di\nfor each valid i, if Ci>0, then S\xe2\x88\x92Di<P\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4P\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4D1<D2<\xe2\x8b\xaf<DN\xe2\x89\xa4109\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (8 points):\n\nT\xe2\x89\xa450\nN\xe2\x89\xa45\nP\xe2\x89\xa420\nDi\xe2\x89\xa420 for each valid i\n\nSubtask #2 (24 points):\n\nP\xe2\x89\xa4103\nDi\xe2\x89\xa4103 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 104\n\nSubtask #3 (68 points): original constraints\nExample Input\n3\n2 10\n1 5\n2 4\n1 5\n3 25\n3 5 10\n\nExample Output\nNO\nYES 0 1\nYES 2 0 2\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: No matter how many 5-cent coins and how many 1-cent coins a person has, if the total sum is at least 10, they will always be able to pay precisely 10 cents without requiring any change.\nExample case 2: If a person has a single 5-cent coin and nothing else, they will not be able to pay precisely 4 cents and will be forced to overpay by giving away his only coin.\nExample case 3: If a person has two 3-cent coins, two 10-cent coins and no 5-cent coins, then the only way to pay 25 cents is by giving away all the coins. They are worth 26 cents in total, so this person is forced to overpay by 1 cent.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85alex_2oo8\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/NOCHANGE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Mathematics, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-01-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
