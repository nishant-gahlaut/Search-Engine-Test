b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given two integers x and N. Consider all integers between 1 and N inclusive, except x. We want to partition these integers into two disjoint sets (each integer has to appear in exactly one set) such that the sums of numbers in these sets are equal.\nFind one valid partition or determine that it doesn\'t exist.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and N.\nOutput\nFor each test case:\nIf there\'s no way to partition the numbers into two sets with equal sums, print a single line containing the string "impossible" (without quotes).\nOtherwise, print a single line containing a string with length N.\nThe x-th character of this string should be \'2\'.\nFor each valid i \xe2\x89\xa0 x, the i-th character of this string should be \'0\' if number i should be in the first set or \'1\' if it should be in the second set.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10,000\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1,000,000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 x \xe2\x89\xa4 N \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of N in all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 1,000,000\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (20 points): sum of N in all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 50\n\n\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 4\n5 5\n1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0201\n01102\nimpossible\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PRTITION\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1884\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-01-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
