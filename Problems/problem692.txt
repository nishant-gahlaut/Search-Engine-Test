b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Bengali as well.\nYou are given an array AA of N elements. You can do the following operations on that array:\n\nRemove the leftmost element of the array, with index l, for the cost Al. This can be done any number of times if the array is non-empty (has at least 1 element).\nRemove the rightmost element of the array, with index r, for the cost Ar. This can be done any number of times if the array is non-empty (has at least 1 element).\nRemove both the leftmost and rightmost element, with indexes l and r respectively, for a fixed cost X which is given. This operation can only be done K times and only if the array has at least 2 elements left.\n\nIf the array has only 1 element left, then the rightmost element is the same as the leftmost element so the first and second operations will have the same cost.\nYou have to print the minimum cost to clear the array (remove all elements using one of the three operations above).\nNOTE: The answer may not fit in 32-bit integers, so please use 64-bit data types in your programming language.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case contains 2 lines of input.\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers: N, K, and X separated by spaces.\nThe second line of each test case contains N space-separated positive integers, A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6AN.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output on one line the minimum cost to clear the array.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4200\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x8c\x8aN2\xe2\x8c\x8b\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n5 2 7\n9 10 11 12 13\n5 0 7\n9 9 9 9 9\n5 2 7\n9 1 2 3 10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n23\n45\n13\n\n\nExplanation\nFor the first test case, we can remove A1 for cost 9, which makes the array [10,11,12,13]. Then we can do the third operation to remove 10 and 13 for cost 7, which makes the array [11,12]. We can again do the third operation to remove 11 and 12 for cost 7 which clears the array.\nThe total cost is therefore 23, which is the minimum cost possible.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85vishesh_s\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CLEARARR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cook132, cook132, easy, easy, greedy, greedy, sorting, sorting, vishesh_s\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2037\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-08-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
