He has N points (X1,Y1),(X2,Y2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(XN,YN) in a 2D plane, and a candle which he wants to place at some point in this plane.\nThe cake is made up of a non-negative number of layers. Chef considers the deliciousness of the cake to be equal to the number of layers in the cake. A layer is a simple polygon whose vertices are some of Chef's N points. It is not required for each of Chef's points to belong to a layer. Furthermore, the layers must satisfy the following conditions:\n\nFor each layer, the candle must lie strictly inside it.\nEach of Chef's N points that lies strictly inside some layer must belong to some other layer or be the candle point.\nNo two layers may touch or intersect.\nThe layers must be chosen in such a way that the deliciousness of the cake is maximum possible.\n\nNow, Chef is wondering about how the deliciousness of the cake depends on where he places the candle. You should answer Q queries. In each query, you are given a point p=(x,y) where Chef wants to place the candle and you have to find the deliciousness of the cake.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.\nN lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Xi and Yi.\nEach of the following Q lines contains two space-separated integers x and y describing a query.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the deliciousness of the cake.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa42,000\n|Xi|,|Yi|\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n|x|,|y|\xe2\x89\xa4109\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5,000\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 2,000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (15 points): N\xe2\x89\xa412\nSubtask #2 (20 points): for each valid i, Xi=0 or Yi=0\nSubtask #3 (65 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n6 2\n0 0\n6 0\n3 4\n2 1\n4 1\n3 3\n6 6\n3 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n\nIn the first query, p=(6,6). The cake cannot have any layers, so its deliciousness is 0.\nIn the second query, p=(3,3). The cake can have only one layer, e.g. a triangle with vertices (2,1),(4,1),(3,4). Other choices of this layer are also possible, but the cake can never have more than one layer.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85pandey__ji\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CONTAIN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Computational Geometry, Convex Hull, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Polygons, Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2461\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-05-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
