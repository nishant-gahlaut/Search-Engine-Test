When XX units of money are inserted into this machine, it produces Reverse(X)Reverse(X) units of money. where Reverse(X)Reverse(X) denotes the decimal number obtained by reversing the decimal representation of XX (without leading zeroes). For example:\n\nReverse(123)=321Reverse(123)=321, since the reverse of "123" is "321"\nReverse(460)=64Reverse(460)=64, since the reverse of "460" is "064", which is 6464 in decimal representation\n\nThe machine is highly unstable and it can be used only once. Abdullah has NN units of money, so he is wondering: how much money should he insert into the machine such that the amount of money produced by the machine is maximum possible? The amount of money inserted into the machine must be an integer between 11 and NN inclusive.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the amount of money Abdullah should insert into the machine.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41010,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41010,000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4104\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n23\n7\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n19\n7\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Inserting X=19X=19 units of money gives Abdullah 9191 units of money.\nExample case 2: Inserting X=7X=7 units of money gives Abdullah 77 units of money.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85abdullah768\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 abdullah768, easy, implementation, ltime72, taran_1407\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-05-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
