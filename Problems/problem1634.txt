b'\nRead problem statements in Russian, Mandarin and Vietnamese as well.\nA string $t_1 t_2 \\ldots t_m$ is called good if there is at most one position $1\\le i < m$ such that $t_i \\ne t_{i+1}$. For example aaabb and zzz are good strings; while abc and ssdddssds are not good.\nYou are given a string $s$, consisting of lowercase English letters.\nFind the minimum $k$ such that you can split $s$ into $k$ good subsequences (a subsequence is not necessarily contiguous). Each character of $s$ should belong to exactly one of the $k$ subsequences.\nIt can be shown that it is always possible to split $s$ into several subsequences this way.\nInput Format\n\nThe only line of the input contains a string $s$.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint a single integer $-$ the answer to the problem.\nConstraints\n\n$1 \\le |s| \\le 10^{6}$\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\naba\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nddb\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 3\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nazazaza\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 3\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 4\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\naddacbdadcbdcdb\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 4\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nFirst sample:\nOne of the splittings of aba into two good subsequences is: \n\nFirst subsequence is a_a.\nSecond subsequence is _b_.\n\nSecond sample:\nSince the string ddb is already good, the answer is $1$.\nThird sample:\nOne of the splittings of azazaza into two good subsequences is: \n\nFirst subsequence is _za_a_a.\nSecond subsequence is a__z_z_.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85dario2994\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ONECHANGE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 SOS DP, Greedy\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n9999\n\n\nDate Added:\n3-12-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n12 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
