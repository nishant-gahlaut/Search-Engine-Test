b'\nRead problems statements in mandarin chinese, russian and vietnamese as well.\n A permutation of length n is an array of size n consisting of n distinct integers in the range [1, n]. For example, (3, 2, 4, 1) is a permutation of length 4, but (3, 3, 1, 4) and (2, 3, 4, 5) are not, as (3, 3, 1, 4) contains duplicate elements, and (2, 3, 4, 5) contains elements not in range [1,4].\nA permutation p of length n is good if and only if for any 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 n, pi \xe2\x89\xa0 i.\nPlease find the lexicographically smallest good permutation p.\nDefinition for "lexicographically smaller":\nFor two permutations p and q, we say that p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if there exists a index 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 l \xe2\x89\xa4 n such that:\n\nFor any 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i < l, pi = qi. Note that if l = 1, this constraint means nothing.\nand, pl < ql.\n\n\nFor example, (2, 3, 1, 4) < (2, 3, 4, 1) < (3, 4, 1, 2). The lexicographically smallest permutation is, of course, (1, 2, ..., n), though this one is not good.\nInput\nFirst line of the input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases.\nFor each test case, the only line contains an integer n.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the lexicographically smallest good permutation of length n. It\'s guaranteed that this permutation exists.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (17 points): 2 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 9\nSubtask #2 (83 points): Original Constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n2\n3\n5\n6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2 1\n2 3 1\n2 1 4 5 3\n2 1 4 3 6 5\n\n\nExplanation\n\nExample case 1. The only good permutation of length 2 is (2, 1).\n\nExample case 2.\xc2\xa0Consider all permutations of length 3, they are(in lexicographically order):\n\np = (1, 2, 3), it\'s not good since p[1] = 1, p[2] = 2 and p[3] = 3;\np = (1, 3, 2), it\'s not good since p[1] = 1;\np = (2, 1, 3), it\'s not good since p[3] = 3;\np = (2, 3, 1), it\'s good since p[1] ? 1, p[2] ? 2 and p[3] ? 3;\np = (3, 1, 2), it\'s good since p[1] ? 1, p[2] ? 2 and p[3] ? 3;\np = (3, 2, 1), it\'s not good since p[2] = 2.\n\nThus the minimum good one is (2, 3, 1).\nExample case 3. Consider two good permutations for third test case: p=(2, 1, 4, 5, 3) and q=(2, 4, 1, 5, 3), then p < q. You can check lexicographically condition as follows. Find the first index where the entries of two permutations are different, and compare those entries. For example, in this case, the first position where the entries differ is index 2. You can see that p[2] < q[2], as 1 < 4, so p is lexicographically smaller than q.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85r_64\n\n\nTester:\njingbo_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MINPERM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1315\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-07-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
