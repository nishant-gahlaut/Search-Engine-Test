b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a rooted tree with NN nodes (numbered 1 through N; node 1 is the root). For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x921), the parent of the node i+1 is pi.\nYou need to answer Q queries. (Sounds quite familiar!) For each query, first, W tasks are given to node V. These tasks are processed in the tree in the following way:\n\nWhen a node receives a tasks and it has no children, all a tasks are executed by this node.\nOtherwise, i.e. if the node has K>0 children, where K is a divisor of a, then this node gives a/K of these tasks to each of its children. This process is performed recursively by each child on the tasks it receives.\nOtherwise, i.e. if the node has K>0 children, but K is not a divisor of a, all a tasks are ignored and none of this node's children receive any tasks.\n\nFor each query, find the number of tasks that are not executed, i.e. end up ignored, possibly after passing down the tree.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N\xe2\x88\x921 space-separated integers p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pN\xe2\x88\x921.\nThe third line contains a single integer Q.\nQ lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers V and W describing a query.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of tasks that are not executed.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\nthe graph described on the input is a tree\n1\xe2\x89\xa4V\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4W\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): N\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n1 1 2 2\n2\n1 10\n1 20\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85dimash241\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ATWNT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Number Theory, DFS, Offline Queries\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Mathematics, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals, Queries\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2368\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
