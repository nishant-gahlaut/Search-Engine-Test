Every donation made to Daenerys is of atat leastleast 11 beastcoinbeastcoin and is displayed on Daenerys\'s stream alongside any message written and is visible to every viewer.\nAfter spotting that Daenerys had set out a target for the streaming day at minimum XX   beastcoins, all her viewers would only donate amounts less than XX beastcoins. Jon decided to better all of them by straight out donating more than or equal to XX beastcoins. Further, he decides to write a message along with his special donation to leave her in awe. His message would be : "Crossing my donation with any other donation will only increase the value of my donation". By Crossing, he means to take the XORXOR . \nBut even for all his intellectual brilliance, money doesn\'t grow on trees for Jon. After all he is an underpaid employee in his fancy big name MNC. Unlike Daenerys\'s daily cash cow who makes videos of how she donated carelessly to other people, Jon has a budget and in this case too, he is looking for the minimum donation he needs to make.\nCan you tell Jon the minimum amount he needs to donate to Daenerys so that he is able to credibly put out the above comment alongside the donation in order to HOPEFULLY win her over.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line contain an interger TT, which denotes number of testcases.
