b"\n          \n            Harshdeep and Navdeep are best friends . Navdeep is good at String manipulation concept. Harshdeep challenged Navdeep to solve one problem related to strings . \n\nHarshdeep gives a string s of length n. Each character is either one of the first k lowercase latin letters or a question mark. Navdeep\xe2\x80\x99s task is to replace every question mark with one of the first k lowercase latin letters in such a way that the following value is maximized. \n\nLet fi be the maximum length substring of string s, which consists entirely of the i-th Latin letter. A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string. If the i-th letter doesn't appear in a string, then fi is equal to 0.\n\nThe value of a string s is the minimum value among fi for all i from 1 to k.\nNavdeep is good at string manipulation , but he is not able to solve this problem . Navdeep asks you to help him.\nYour task is to print maximum value the string can have?\n\n            \n                \n                    Input Format\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the string and the number of first Latin letters used.\nThe second line contains a string s, consisting of n characters. Each character is either one of the first k lowercase Latin letters or a question mark.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum value of the string after every question mark is replaced with one of the first k lowercase Latin letters.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa417\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n10 2\na??ab????b\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85mahendra444\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/HARSTR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 mahendra444, medium, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-10-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
