Now, Alice is thinking about what to give Chef as a present. She should obviously choose a sequence \xe2\x80\x95 what could possibly be a better birthday gift than a sequence!\nAfter some thinking, Alice chose a sequence of integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. However, she does not want to simply give this sequence to Chef. Instead, she decided to give Chef a sequence B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN, where Bi=\xe2\x8b\x81ij=1Aj for each valid i and \xe2\x8b\x81 denotes the bitwise OR operation. Chef can try to generate a sequence A from B, but there could be more than one such possible sequence.\nNow, Alice is wondering how many sequences A correspond to the given sequence B. Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo 109+7. Note that it is not guaranteed that the given sequence B was generated from some sequence A.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of possible sequences A modulo 109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa425\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85104\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Bi<230 for each valid i\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2\n2 3\n4\n2 6 7 7\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n64\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: There are two possible options for A: (2,1) and (2,3).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85ezio_26\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MYSARA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 basic, bit-manipulation, combinatorics, cook116, easy, ezio_26, tmwilliamlin\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1939\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-03-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
