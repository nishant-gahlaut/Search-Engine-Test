b"\nLittle Bear had just come back from school. He was very hungry that time and wanted at least K units of honey to satisfy his hunger. He immediately went to a rectangular field of size N x M to collect some honey. He wanted to collect honey only\nin a special sub-rectangle which has size S x T where S<=A and T<=B, for some fixed A and B. He has Q queries, each query contains A, B. For each query, he wanted to know how many special sub-rectangles contain at least K units of honey. \n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains integers N, M  and K(1<=N, M<=300, 1<=K<=N*M). \nThe next N lines contain M characters (either 'H' or '.'). 'H' means there is honey in that cell, while '.' means there is no honey in that cell.\nThe next line contains an integer Q (1<=Q<=100 000).\nThe next Q lines contain integers A and B (1<=A<=N , 1<=B<=M).\n\n\n\nOutput\nThe output contains Q lines, each line contains the number of special sub-rectangles which satisfy the requirement. (The amount of honey is at least K inside the special sub-rectangle)\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5 5 4\nH.H..\n..H..\nH...H\nHHHH.\nHH..H\n2\n1 1\n2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nExplanation for 2nd query\n\n#: means the chosen cell\nThe possibilities are:\n1. Size 2 x 3\nH.H..\n..H..\n###.H\n###H.\nHH..H\n\n2. Size 2 x 3\nH.H..\n..H..\nH...H\n###H.\n###.H\n\n3. Size 2 x 3\nH.H..\n..H..\nH...H\nH###.\nH###H\n\n4. Size 2 x 2\nH.H..\n..H..\nH...H\n##HH.\n##..H\n\n\nNote that in 2nd query, the possible special sub-rectangles are of size 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 2x1, 2x2, 2x3. Also note that 2x3 is different from 3x2\n                \n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\nAuthor:\nharta_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85pieguy\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/HBEAR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Pre processing, DP Approach\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1979\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-10-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
