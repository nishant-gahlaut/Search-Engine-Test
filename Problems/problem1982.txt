b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nIn this problem we will have a few definitions as described below:\n\nBinary string: A string containing only characters \'0\' and \'1\'.\nHamming distance of the two binary string of the same length is the number of the positions where the two strings have \n  different characters. eg. the hamming distance of "01010101" and\n  "00110111" is 3, the hamming distance of a binary string with itself is 0.\nSub-string of a string is a segment of contiguous characters of that string.\n\n\n\nYou would be given two binary strings A and B with the length of N and M respectively. \nYou need to calculate the Hamming distance between B and every sub-strings of length M of A.\n\n\t\nFor this problem, you will be given a fixed string A. There will be K queries each containing a string representing B. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains the binary string A.\nThe next line contains an integer K.\nEach of the next K lines contains a binary string B.\n\nOutput\nTo avoid generating large output, for each query string B instead of printing N - M + 1 values of Hamming distance between\nsub-strings of A and B in the order of the position of the sub-string in A, you only need to print \nthe hash value of this sequence as described below.\nLet s[0..L -1] be a sequence of L integers. The recursive function f(s) will return the hash value of s.\n\nif L = 1, f(s) = s[0] mod 1000000007\nOtherwise, f(s) = (f(s[0..L-2]) * 100001 + s[L-1]) mod 1000000007\n\n\nSo overall, your output should be K lines, each containing the hash value corresponding to the query string B.\n\nConstraints\n\n20 points:\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n\n\n\n40 points:\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 50000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n\n\n\n40 points:\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n10101\n3\n101\n00\n0101\n\nOutput:\n300003\n993599731\n400004\n\nExplanation:\nFirst test case:  A = "10101", B = "101". \nThe Hamming distances sequence will be (0, 3, 0) and the hash value of this sequence is 300003.\nSecond test case:  A = "10101", B = "00". The Hamming distances sequence will be (1, 1, 1, 1) \nand the hash of this sequence is 993599731.\nThird test case: A = "10101", B = "0101". The Hamming distances sequence will be (4, 0)\nand the hash value of this sequence is ((4 mod 1000000007) * 100001 + 0) mod 1000000007 = 400004.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ntuan_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85stzgd\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TASTRMAT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bitwise Operation, FFT\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Bit Manipulation, Transformations\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2708\n\n\nDate Added:\n6-12-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
