TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases is as follows.\nThe next line of the input contains a single integer NN. NN denotes the total number of Islands.\nThe next line of the input contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,A3...AnA1,A2,A3...An where ithith number denotes the maximum number of coins that the king of ithith island can donate.\nNext line contains a single integer QQ. QQ denotes the total number of times traveler have to go for the trip.\nNext QQ lines contains, two space-separated integers Q1,Q2Q1,Q2 denoting the start and end number of islands, i.e. traveler will start the trip from Q1thQ1th island and will go till Q2thQ2th island, in each trip.\n\nNote: islands are numbered from 11 to NN.\nOutput:\n\nFor each trip print the total number of gold coins, traveler will collect(each on a new line).\n\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A1,A2,A3...An\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4A1,A2,A3...An\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q1,Q2\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4Q1,Q2\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nSample Input:\n1\n4\n10 2 5 50\n2\n1 3\n2 4\n\nSample Output:\n17\n57\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn 1st Trip, traveler will go from 1st Island to 3rd Island, hence the total number of coins traveler can collect is 10+2+5 = 17\nIn 2 d Trip, traveler will go from 2nd Island to 4th Island, hence the total number of coins traveler can collect is 2+5+50 = 57\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\npro_army\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GOLDTRIP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 array, arys2020, easy, pro_army\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-11-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
