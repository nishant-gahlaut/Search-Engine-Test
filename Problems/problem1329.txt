b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\nChef has a sequence A consisting of N integers each lying between 1 and K, both inclusive. Now he wants to construct another sequence B of the same length also containing integers between 1 and K (again, both inclusive). Find out in how many ways he can construct the sequence B, such that the length of Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)  of A and B is exactly L. As the answer could be large, print it modulo 109 + 7.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines: \n\nThe first line of each test case contains three space separated integers N, K, and L.\nThe second line contains N space separated integers A1, A2, ... AN. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case output the number of ways to construct B as described above. Output the result modulo 109 + 7.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N,K \xe2\x89\xa4 16 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 L \xe2\x89\xa4 N \nThe sequence A consists of integers between 1 and K (both inclusive). \n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2 2 1\n1 2\n3 3 2\n1 2 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n11\n\n\nExplanation\n\nFirst Example : There are total three possible valid sequences B : [1, 1], [2, 2] and [2, 1]. LCS of these sequences with sequence A is equal to 1. Note that [1, 2] is not a valid sequence as LCS of this and sequence A is equal to 2. \n\n\nSecond Example: The 11 ways are: [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [1, 2, 3],  [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 2], [2, 2, 1],  [2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 3, 2],  [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 2].\n\nNote\nTwo sequences of B are considered different if there is at least one position which contains different numbers in the sequences.\n                \n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\nAuthor:\nimran_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85iscsi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SEQLCS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DP Bitmask, Longest Common Subsequence\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, DP on sequences\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3031\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-08-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n4 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
