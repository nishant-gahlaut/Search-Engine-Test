b'\n\xc2\xa0\nYou must have tried to solve the Rubik\xe2\x80\x99s cube. You might even have succeeded at it. Rubik\xe2\x80\x99s cube is a 3x3x3 cube which has 6 different color for each face.The Rubik\xe2\x80\x99s cube is made from 26 smaller pieces which are called cubies. There are 6 cubies at the centre of each face and these comprise of a single color. There are 8 cubies at the 8 corners which comprise of exactly 3 colors. The 12 reamaining cubies comprise of exactly 2 colors.\nApple has come up with a variation of the Rubik\xe2\x80\x99s Cube, it\xe2\x80\x99s the Rubik\xe2\x80\x99s cuboid which has different colors on its 6 faces. The Rubik\xe2\x80\x99s Cuboid comes in various sizes represented by M x N x O (M,N,O are natural numbers). Apple is giving away 100 Rubik\xe2\x80\x99s cuboid for free to people who can answer a simple questions. Apple wants to know, in a Rubik\xe2\x80\x99s cuboid with arbitrary dimensions, how many cubies would be there, which comprise of exactly 2 color.\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nThe input contains several test cases.The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nEach test case comprises of 3 natural numbers, M,N & O, which denote the dimensions of the Rubiks Cuboid.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case you are required to output the number of  cubies which comprise of 2 squares, each of which is of a different color.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 <1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 <100000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 <100000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 O \xe2\x89\xa4 <100000\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n1\n3\n3\n3\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n12\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85ravit0001\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/INLO22\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, implementation, inlo2016, ravit0001\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-03-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
