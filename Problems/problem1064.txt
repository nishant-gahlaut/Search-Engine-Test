b"\nGood's Train is a train which carry weights like grains, vegetables, and many other things in it.\nYou are given a task to add weights in each compartment of this good's train. Initially train compartments may or may not be empty, and you will be given qq task, in each task you will be provided with 3 data stated as below.\n\nstart number of compartment\nend number of compartment\nThe weights, that needs to be onboarded in each compartment in the given range.\n\nAfter you have completed all your qq tasks, you will need to give the total weights that is currently in this Good's Train.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT. TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases is as follows.\nThe next line of the input contains a single integer NN. NN denotes the total number of compartments in Good's Train(numbered from 11 to NN).\nThe next line of the input contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,A3...AnA1,A2,A3...An where ithith number denotes the initial weight of Good's that ithith compartment have.\nThe next line of the input contains a single integer qq. qq denotes the total number of tasks given to you.\nNext qq lines contains, 3 space-separated integers S,E,WS,E,W denoting the start, end number of compartments(both inclusive) and WW denotes the weight to be onboarded in each compartment.\n\nOutput:\n\nAfter completing all your qq tasks, print the total weights that is currently in this Good's Train.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41021\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4102\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A1,A2,A3...An\xe2\x89\xa41071\xe2\x89\xa4A1,A2,A3...An\xe2\x89\xa4107\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4S,E\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4S,E\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa41071\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4107\n\nSample Input:\n1\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n2\n1 3 10\n2 4 15\n\nSample Output:\n90\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\npro_army\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TRAINWT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 array, arys2020, easy, pro_army\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-11-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
