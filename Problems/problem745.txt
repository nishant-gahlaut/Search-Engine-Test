b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nChef loves squares! You are given N points with integers coordinates, Chef asks you to find out how many points he should add to these set of N points, so that one could create at least one square having its vertices from the points of the resulting set. Note that the square created need not to be parallel to the axis.\nInput\nThe first line contains singe integer N. \nEach of next N lines contains two integers Xi and Yi denotine the coordinates of i-th point. \nOutput\nIn a single line print single integer - the minimal number of points Chef need to paint to receive at least one square. \nConstraints\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 2000\n-10^6 \xe2\x89\xa4 Xi, Yi \xe2\x89\xa4 10^6\nThere are NO coincided points\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n0 0\n2 2\n3 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nFor the first example Chef can add points (2, 0), (0, 2) or (2, 3), (3, 2)\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n0 0\n100 100\n200 200\n100 0\n0 100\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nFor the second example Chef already has square (0, 0), (100, 0), (0, 100), (100, 100). \n\n\n\nAuthor:\nberezin\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85shangjingbo\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFSQUA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Geometry, Squares, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Mathematics, Computational Geometry, Polygons, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1994\n\n\nDate Added:\n3-04-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
