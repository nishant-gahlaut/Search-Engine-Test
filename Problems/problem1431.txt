b"\nChef's girlfriend, Chief, is displeased with him. This is not a good sign for their\n    relationship, and as always, he has turned to you for help. He looks forward to take his girlfriend to shopping;\n    offering her to buy 'K' gifts. The shop that he is taking her to has 'N' unique items, that is,\n    there is single quantity of each item (its a very special shop, you see!).\nChef has with him, K discount coupons that he wishes to use. The shop's policy\n    only allows Chef to use one discount coupon on any one purchased item. That is why Chef is letting Chief buy K\n    gifts; he intends to use each coupon with him.\nChef of course cannot stop Chief from buying whatever she likes. Chief would select any K\n    gifts, from among the N items that the shop has. She makes selection of any K out of N items, uniformly. Suppose,\n    there are 5 items and Chef lets Chief buy 3, then she selects any of the 3 out of 5 items with the probability 1/10.\nAfter Chief selects the items she wishes to buy, Chef will have to pay the bill. Smart as he\n    is, he would apply the K discount coupons on the K items (one on each) such that the discount he receives is as large\n    as possible.\nChef wants to prepare himself for this day. He knows beforehand the price of each item\n    in the shop. Can you tell him what expected discount can he expect? You have to tell him the expected discount\n    in the amount of money he can expect to save.\nInput format\nThe first line contains the number T, the number of test cases. In the following lines,\n    T test cases follow (without any newlines between them.)\nEach case consists of only 3 lines.\nThe first line of each test case contains N and K, separated by a single space.\nThe second line contains N positive integers, the prices of the N items respectively, separated by a single space.\nThe third line contains K positive integers (between 1 and 100, inclusive) separated by a single space. They represent\nthe percentage of discount offered by the coupons, that Chef has, respectively.\nOutput format\nFor each test case, print the expected amount of money Chef should expect to save.\n    Output the result rounded to 3 digits after the decimal.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 50\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 prices \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 2\n100 200 300\n10 20\n4 3\n100 200 300 400\n10 20 30\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n66.667\n175.000\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the second case, Chief can make the following selections:\n(100, 200, 300), with probability 1/4. Chef can apply the coupons to at best save 140.\n(100, 200, 400), with probability 1/4. Chef can apply the coupons to at best save 170.\n(100, 300, 400), with probability 1/4. Chef can apply the coupons to at best save 190.\n(200, 300, 400), with probability 1/4. Chef can apply the coupons to at best save 200.\nThus Chef can save an expected (140 + 170 + 190 + 200) / 4 = 175.000\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85shilp_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85anton_lunyov\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHIEFETT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Expected Value, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Probability, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2066\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-07-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.331034 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
