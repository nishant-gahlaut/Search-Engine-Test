b'\nChef Datta likes betting in Indian Premier League very much.\nHe has 10000 rupees. Today the match is between team A and team B. The winning probability of team A is PA, and hence winning probability of team B is PB = 1 \xe2\x88\x92 PA. \nDatta is free to bet any integral amount of money on any of the two teams as long as the total amount of money bet is at most 10000 rupees.\nHelp him know the expected amount of money he will eventually have if today he places his bet(s) optimally.Rules of the game:\nIf team X with winning probability PX actually wins and someone bets M rupees on this team, he will gain (2*(1\xe2\x88\x92PX)) * M rupees.\nIf team X with winning probability PX actually loses and someone bets N rupees on this team, he will just lose N rupees.\nInput\nFirst line contains single integer T, the number of testcases. Then T lines follow, each line contains PA the probability that team A wins.\nOutput\nFor each test case output single line containing the expected amount of money Datta will eventually have today if he places his bet(s) optimally. Your answer will be accepted if the absolute error is less than 10\xe2\x88\x926.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100001 (105+1)\n0.0 \xe2\x89\xa4  PA \xe2\x89\xa4 1.0\nPA has at most 5 digits after the decimal point.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n0.510\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n10098\n\n\nExplanation\n                    Look at the following situation:\n\nIf chef  Datta bets 6,000 on team A and 4,000 on team B, the expected amount of money he will have after the bet is settled is 10,018. Apparently that is not the best he can do ;)\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nmani_adm\n\n\nTester:\n5\xe2\x98\x85tuananh93\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PREDICT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, june13, mani_adm, probability\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1510\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-04-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
