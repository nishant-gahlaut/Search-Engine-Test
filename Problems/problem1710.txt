b'\nYou are given a tree with N nodes, numbered from 1 to N. It is rooted at node 1, and each node i is labelled with a positive integer labeli.\n\xe2\x80\x98Y Figures\xe2\x80\x99 of a node X are defined as the number of ordered triplets of nodes (A, B, C) satisfying:\n\nlabelA = labelB = labelC = labelX.\nA is an ancestor of X.\nB and C are in the subtree of X and LCA(B,C) = X. \nA, B, C, X are pairwise distinct.\n\nYou need to answer Q queries of the form \xe2\x80\x98X Z\xe2\x80\x99. For each query, Change the label of node X to Z and report the number of \xe2\x80\x98Y Figures\xe2\x80\x99 of the node X.  \nNote: Changes are not persistent. Each query is independent of every other query. \nIt is advised to use fast I/O methods.\nInput\n\nFirst Line of Input consists of a single integer T, the number of test cases.\nFirst line of every test case contains of two Integers, N and Q,  denoting number of nodes in the tree and the number of queries respectively.\nThe second line of input consists of N integers,  where the i-th integer represents labeli, the label of node i (1-indexed).\nThe next N - 1 lines contain two integers, a and b,  denoting that an edge exists between node a and node b.\nThe next Q lines contain two integers, X and Z where X is the node and Z is the new label of the node for the current query.\n\nOutput\n\nFor every testcase, output Q lines, where each line is the answer to each query in the order of input.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Sum of all N \xe2\x89\xa4 200000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 a, b \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 X \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Sum of all Q \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Z, labeli \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000000\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n6 2\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n2 5\n2 6\n2 1\n2 2\n\nOutput:\n10\n0\n\nExplanation\nFor query \xe2\x80\x982 1\xe2\x80\x99, the satisfying triplets are (1,3,5), (1,3,6), (1,4,5), (1,4,6), (1,5,6), (1,5,3), (1,5,4), (1,6,5), (1,6,3) and (1,6,4). \nFor query \xe2\x80\x982 2\xe2\x80\x99, there are no satisfying triplets.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kr_abhinav\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/YFG\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Disjoint Set Union, HLD, DSU on Trees\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2863\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-03-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
