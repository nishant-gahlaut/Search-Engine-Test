In other words, the cities and roads form a tree. For each valid i, the i-th city's height above sea level is Ai.\nA path between two cities is said to be beautiful if the heights of the cities in the path first increase and then decrease. In other words, when we denote the sequence of cities the path passes through by x1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xL, it is beautiful if Ax1<Ax2<\xe2\x80\xa6<Axp>\xe2\x80\xa6>AxL\xe2\x88\x921>AxL holds for some integer p (1\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x89\xa4L).\nChefina is planning a trip along a path in the tree. You should answer Q queries. In each query, you are given two cities x and y and you should tell Chefina if the simple path between these cities is beautiful.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.\nEach of the following N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting that cities u and v are connected by a road.\nThe next line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nEach of the following Q lines contains two space-separated integers x and y describing a query.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing a string with length Q. For each valid i, the i-th character of this string should be '1' if the path in the i-th query is beautiful or '0' otherwise.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4200\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5 4\n1 5\n1 2\n4 2\n2 3\n4 6 2 1 5\n1 5\n3 4\n3 2\n5 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1110\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The sequence of heights of cities on the path from city 1 to city 5 is [4,5], and 4<5 holds, so it is a beautiful path.\nExample case 2: The sequence of heights of cities on the path from city 3 to city 4 is [2,6,1], and 2<6>1, so it is a beautiful path.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85rishup_nitdgp\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFTRIP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DP on Trees, Lowest Common Ancestor, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2328\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-05-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
