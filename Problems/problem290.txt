b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nToday is Chef\'s birthday. His mom decided to surprise him with a truly fantastic gift: his favourite binary string B. But, unfortunately, all the stocks of binary string B have been sold out, and only a binary string A (A \xe2\x89\xa0 B) is available in the market.\nShe purchases the string A and tries to convert it to string B by applying any of following three operations zero or more times.\n\nAND Operation:\nShe will choose a pair of indices i and j such that i != j and perform following sequence of operations.\n\n result = Ai & Aj \n Ai = result & Ai \n Aj = result & Aj \n\n\n\nOR Operation:\nShe will choose a pair of indices i and j such that i != j and perform following sequence of operations.\n\n result = Ai | Aj \n Ai = result | Ai \n Aj = result | Aj \n\n\n\nXOR Operation:\nShe will choose a pair of indices i and j such that i != j and perform following sequence of operations.\n\n result = Ai ^ Aj \n Ai = result ^ Ai \n Aj = result ^ Aj \n\n\nChef\'s mom is eagerly waiting to surprise him with his favourite gift and therefore, she wants to convert string A to string B as fast as possible. Can you please help her by telling her the minimum number of operations she will require? If it is impossible to do so, then let Chef\'s mom know about it.\nInput\nFirst line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow.\nFirst line of each test case, will contain binary string A.\nSecond line of each test case, will contain binary string B.\nOutput\nFor each test case, Print "Lucky Chef" (without quotes) in first line and minimum number of operations required to convert string A to sting B in second line if conversion is possible. Print "Unlucky Chef" (without quotes) in a new line otherwise.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |A| \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |B| \xe2\x89\xa4 106\nA != B\n|A| = |B|\nsum of |A| over all test cases does not exceed 106\nsum of |B| over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\n\n Subtask #1 (40 points) : Sum of |A| & |B| over all test cases does not exceed 103\n Subtask #2 (60 points) : Sum of |A| & |B| over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n101\n010\n1111\n1010\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nLucky Chef\n2\nUnlucky Chef\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.\n\nApplying XOR operation with indices i = 1 and j = 2.
