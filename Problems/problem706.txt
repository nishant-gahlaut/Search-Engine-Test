b"\nA daily train consists of N cars. Let's consider one particular car. It has 54 places numbered consecutively from 1 to 54, some of which are already booked and some are still free. The places are numbered in the following fashion:\nThe car is separated into 9 compartments of 6 places each, as shown in the picture. So, the 1st compartment consists of places 1, 2, 3, 4, 53 and 54, the 2nd compartment consists of places 5, 6, 7, 8, 51 and 52, and so on.\n\nA group of X friends wants to buy tickets for free places, all of which are in one compartment (it's much funnier to travel together). You are given the information about free and booked places in each of the N cars. Find the number of ways to sell the friends exactly X tickets in one compartment (note that the order in which the tickets are sold doesn't matter).\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains two integers X and N (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 X \xe2\x89\xa4 6, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10) separated by a single space. Each of the following N lines contains the information about one car which is a string of length 54 consisting of '0' and '1'. The i-th character (numbered from 1) is '0' if place i in the corresponding car is free, and is '1' if place i is already booked.\n\nOutput\nOutput just one integer -- the requested number of ways.\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 3\n100101110000001011000001111110010011110010010111000101\n001010000000101111100000000000000111101010101111111010\n011110011110000001010100101110001011111010001001111010\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n85\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the first test case, any of the free places can be sold.\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n6 3\n100101110000001011000001111110010011110010010111000101\n001010000000101111100000000000000111101010101111111010\n011110011110000001010100101110001011111010001001111010\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the second test case, the only free compartment in the train is compartment 3 in the first car (places 9, 10, 11, 12, 49 and 50 are all free).\n\n                        Sample Input 3\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3 2\n000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 3\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n360\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the third test case, the train is still absolutely free; as there are 20 ways to sell 3 tickets in an empty compartment, the answer is 2 * 9 * 20 = 360.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ngennady_adm\n\n\nTester:\n4\xe2\x98\x85chmel_tolstiy\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DAILY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, Combinatorics, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1222\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-01-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2.992 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
