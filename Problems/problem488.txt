b"\nIt is JJ's birthday and you decide to gift him a string SS (consisting of English alphabet only) of length NN. But you also know that JJ does not like palindromes so you decide that none of the substrings of S of length \xe2\x89\xa52 should be a palindrome.\nCan you find any suitable string which can be gifted to JJ?\nRecall that a string is called palindrome if it reads the same backwards and forwards, for e.g. noon and level are palindromic strings.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains an integer N - the length of the string S to be constructed.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output a string S of length N such that none of its substrings (of length \xe2\x89\xa52) is a palindrome.\nIf there are multiple strings which satisfy the condition, print any.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2\n2\n4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\ngl\nhf\nwaow\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: gl is the only substring of length \xe2\x89\xa52 and it is not a palindrome.\nTest case 2: hf is the only substring of length \xe2\x89\xa52 and it is not a palindrome. \nTest case 3: Following are the substrings of length \xe2\x89\xa52:\n\nLength=2: wa, ao, ow\nLength=3: wao, aow\nLength=4: waow\n\nWe can see that none of these substrings is a palindrome. \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85jeevanjyot\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/NOPAL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cook137, easy, jeevanjyot, palindrome\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1360\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-01-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
