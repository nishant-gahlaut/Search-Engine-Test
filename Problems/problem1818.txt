b'\nOur chef is a teacher in a school named lobhabul Canadians.and there are N number of\nstudents numbered from 1 to N in his class.\nOne day he decided to check the logical and thinking ability of his students by making them\nperform a fun activity. He told every student to write any number M and made them stand in\na row.Let a1,a2 \xe2\x80\xa6an be the number chosen by students 1,2,3,\xe2\x80\xa6,N.\nYour task is to choose any two students standing at i and j location and interchange their\nposition. You can perform this operation any number of times possibly zero times .such that\nafter performing all operations, no three consecutive students should be having the same\nnumber.\nSo, your task to tell whether it is possible to arrange the students in a row\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer t, denoting the number of\ntest cases. The description of each test case follows.\nThe first line of every test case follows contains an integer N denoting the\na total number of students.\nThe next line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6.,an. Which\ndenotes the number chosen by students from 1 to N.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if all people can be\narranged according to the rules of the chef or "NO" otherwise (without quotes)\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4a[i]\xe2\x89\xa4109 \nThe Sum of N over all test cases will be less than equal to 5 x 10^5\n\nSample Input:\n    2\n    9\n    2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n    5\n    1 2 1 2 3\n\nSample Output:\n    NO\n    YES\n\nEXPLANATION:\nIn 1st case, since there is no way, such that no 3 students can have the same value.\nIn the 2nd case, In the first step, we can swap the students standing at positions 3 and 5 having\nvalues 1 and 3 respectively.\nAfter 1st swap arrangement becomes 1 2 3 2 1\nNow we can swap 4 and 5th student\nAnd our arrangement becomes 1 2 3 1 2 and here you can see no three consecutive\nstudents are having the same value.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85abhinav_526\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/NUART\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 abhinav_526, brbg2020, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
