b'\n\xc2\xa0\n\nIn DELHI,, there are junctions connected by roads. There is at most one road between any pair of junctions.\n There is no road connecting a junction to itself. The travel time for a road is the same in both directions.\n\nAt every junction there is a single traffic light. These traffic lights are a bit peculiar.\n Starting from time 0, each light flashes green once every T time units, where the value of T is different for each junction.\n\nA vehicle that is at a junction can start moving along a road only when the light at the current junction flashes green. \nIf a vehicle arrives at a junction between green flashes, it must wait for the next green flash before continuing in any direction. \nIf it arrives at a junction at exactly the same time that the light flashes green, it can immediatly proceed along any road originating from that junction.\n\nYou are given a city map that shows travel times for all roads. For each junction i, you are given Ti, the time period between green flashes of the light at that junction.\n Your task is to find the minimum time taken from a given source junction to a given destination junction for a vehicle when the traffic starts.\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\n\n-There are N junctions and M roads. The junctions are identified by integers 1 through N.\n\nThe first line of input contains two integers: the source junction and the destination junction.\nThe second line contains two integers: N and M.\nThe third line contains N integers, T1, T2,\xe2\x80\xa6TN, describing the time periods at which the traffic lights flash green. The light at junction i flashes green at times 0, Ti, 2Ti, 3Ti, \xe2\x80\xa6\nThe next M lines contain information about the M roads. Each line has three integers i, j, lij , where:\n i and j are the junctions connected by this road\n lij is the time required to move from junction i to junction j using this road\nOutput\n\nA single line consisting of a single integer, the time taken by a minimum-time path from source to destination.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 300\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 14000\n \xe2\x89\xa4 ti \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 lij \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n\n1 4\n4 5\n4 3 2 5\n1 2 4\n1 3 8\n2 3 6\n2 4 10\n3 4 7\n\nOutput:\n\n15\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\n1 to 2 to 4 takes time 4 + 2 (wait till 6) + 10 = 16.\n1 to 3 to 4 takes time 8 + 0 (no wait) + 7 = 15.\n1 to 2 to 3 to 4 takes time 4 + 2 (wait till 6) + 6 + 0 (no wait) + 7 = 19.\n1 to 3 to 2 to 4 takes time 8 + 0 (no wait) + 6 + 1 (wait till 15) + 10 = 25.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85ravit0001\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/INLO33\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dijkstra-algorithm, graphs, hard, inlo1601, ravit0001, shortest-path\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-03-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
