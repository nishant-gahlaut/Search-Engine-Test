b'\nBob is moving soon, and he wants to choose a truck that can hold a certain amount of weight. He knows the weights of all the items he is putting on the truck. Can you help him determine the maximum number of items that he can put on a truck of any given weight?\nYou are given an array aa of nn integers, the weights of the items. Then, you are given qq queries, each of which is a possible weight of a truck. You must print the number of items that can fit on the truck, each item with weight a[i]a[i].\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers nn and qq. nn is the number of items, and qq is the number of weight queries.\nThe next line contains an array aa of nn integers, the weights of each item.\nThe next qq lines contain one integer each, the weight of the truck.\n\nOutput:\nThere should be q lines of output, the answer to each query.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4a[i]\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4a[i]\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4q[i]\xe2\x89\xa410180\xe2\x89\xa4q[i]\xe2\x89\xa41018\n\nSample Input 1:\n10 2\n1 1 8 2 5 1 6 6 1 2\n3\n8\n\nSample Output 1:\n3\n6\n\nEXPLANATION:\nIn the first query, only 3 items can be taken for a truck with weight 3. These items all have weights 1, 1, and 1.\nIn the second query, 6 items can be taken for a truck with weight 8. These items have weights 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, and 1.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85samhenry97\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FLTRCK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 array, binary-search, easy, samhenry97\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-05-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
