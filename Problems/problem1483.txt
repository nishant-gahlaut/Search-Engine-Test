b'\nA sequence of N integers is called K-unique if, when it is split into N/K subsequences of K contiguous elements, each subsequence consists of K distinct integers.\nFor example, consider this sequence of 6 integers.\n(2, 10, 2, 8, 3, 6)\nThis sequence is 2-unique, because when you split it into 3 subsequences each of 2 contiguous elements as below,\n(2, 10), (2, 8), (3, 6),\neach subsequence consists of 2 distinct integers.\nYou are given a sequence of N integers, and a positive integer K. Find a permutation of the sequence that is K-unique.\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers N and K. The next line contains a sequence of N integers ai, where ai is the i-th element of the sequence.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing a permutation of the sequence that is K-unique. The elements of the sequence should be separated by a single space. If there are several solutions, output the lexicographically smallest one. If there is no solution, output -1.\nConstraints\n1 <= T <= 5\n1 <= N <= 50000\n1<= K<= N\nN will be divisible by K\n0 <= ai <= 1000000000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1 1\n42\n4 2\n4 7 7 7\n6 2\n2 10 2 8 3 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n42\n-1\n2 3 2 6 8 10\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n1\xe2\x98\x85ashar_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85pieguy\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/KUNIQUE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sets, Hashmaps, Greedy, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1901\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-10-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
