b"\nYou are given a matrix C that has N rows and M columns where each entry is 1 or 0 or x. Here x denotes a don't care value. \nYou can perform the following operation on the matrix:\n\nPick any column j such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4M.\nAssign Ci,j\xe2\x86\x92Ci,j\xe2\x8a\x951 for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nYou are given that:\n\n0\xe2\x8a\x951=1\n1\xe2\x8a\x951=0\nx\xe2\x8a\x951=x\nwhere \xe2\x8a\x95 denotes the bitwise XOR operation.\n\nYou have to perform any number of operations (possibly 0) such that each row in the matrix has at most a single 1.\nDetermine if it's possible to achieve this. Print YES if it's possible, else print NO.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line will contain T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case has two integers N and M - the number of rows and number of columns respectively.  \nThe next M lines of the test case contain N characters each where the j-th character in the i-th line denotes Ci,j.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint YES if it's possible to perform any number of operations so that each row has at most a single 1, else print NO.\nYou may print each character of Yes and No in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, YES will be considered identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4400\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41000\nSum of N\xe2\x8b\x85M over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 2\n00\n11\n4 5\n10x1x\n1xx11\nxx101\n1x11x\n3 3\n101\n010\n100\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\n\nTest case-1: We just perform one operation on the first column.\nTest case-2: We perform the operations on the columns 1,3 and 5.\nTest case-3: It can be proven that it is impossible to satisfy the given conditions using any number of operations.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85pranav_dv\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85tabr\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/OH1DCARE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 2-sat, 2-sat, cook139, cook139, medium, medium, pranav_dv\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2854\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-03-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
