b"\nSick of his captivity during the quarantine times, Debrup decided to ring up his best friend Kushagra and challenge his programming skills. \nBeing an array freak, it wasn't long before he came up with a delicious problem on arrays.\nThe task is simple(or so he thought).\nKushagra would be given two independent arrays AA and BB, of equal or unequal sizes \nnn  and mm.\nLet's define a Bilateral segment of one array as a maximum subarray, which has each of its elements in another array.\nIn other words, a Bilateral segment of a sequence AA is a list of consecutive numbers such that each of these is present in the other given sequence BB.\nHe is required to find the number of bilateral segments in AA with respect to BB.\nRemember that the segment must be maximal in nature, or there exists no bilateral super segment.\nThe two given sequences given are independent of each other.\nUnfortunately, Kushagra is participating in an ongoing contest due to which he is not willing to give this question a try.\nAt the same time, he doesn't want to let Debrup down. Stuck in a dilemma, he now turns to you\nto help him answer this question. Help him to do the same.\nInput:\n\nFirst-line will contain TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer nn, size of the array AA.\nSecond-line contains nn space-separated integers  elements of array AA.\nThe third line contains a single integer mm, size of the array BB.\nThe last line of each test case contains mm space separated integers elements of the array BB. \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output a single integer number of bilateral segments.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4500\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,Bi\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,Bi\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\nSample Input:\n3\n4\n0 1 2 3\n3\n0 1 3\n1\n5\n1\n2\n10\n2 5 7 8 9 6 3 1 4 5\n6\n1 3 4 2 7 6    \nSample Output:\n2\n0\n3    \nEXPLANATION:\nTest 1:\n2 segments (0,1)(0,1) and (3)(3)\nTest 2:\nNo possible segment.\nTest 3:\n3 possible segments (2)(2) , (7)(7) and (6,3,1,4)(6,3,1,4)\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kkdrummer\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COW3B\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 basic, cow42020, easy, hashing, kkdrummer\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-04-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
