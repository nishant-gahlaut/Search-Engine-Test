b"\n\nFor given two positive integers a and b let's construct the sequence x[1], x[2], ... by the following rules. For k=1 we put x[1]=1. Now let k >= 2. Then x[k] is the least positive integer such that the following two conditions hold\nx[k] > x[k - 1];\n for all i, j < k we have x[k] is not equal to a * x[i] - b * x[j].\n\nYou need to find the first n terms of this sequence.\nRemark. Let a=2 and b=1. Then we see that sequence x[1], x[2], ... does not contain any arithmetic progression of length three as its subsequence. This justifies the problem title.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains three integers a, b and n.\n\nOutput\n For each test case, output a single line containing the numbers x[1], x[2], ..., x[n] generated by the rules given in the problem statement and numbers a, b. Separate any two consecutive numbers in a line by a single space.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <= 50\n\n1 <= a, b <= 50\n\n1 <= n <= 1000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 1 10\n1 1 5\n4 2 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 2 4 5 10 11 13 14 28 29\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 3 4 5\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85anton_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85pieguy\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GENARSEQ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sets, Maps, Constructive, Implementation, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1792\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-10-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.712667 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
