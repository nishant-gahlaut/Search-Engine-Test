b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\n Devu loves to play with binary strings a lot. One day he borrowed a binary string s of size n from his friend Churu. Before starting to play with it, he wants to make sure that string does not contain more than  k consecutive equal characters. For achieving that, only kind of operation he is allowed to perform is to flip any ith character of the string. \n\n\nAs Devu is always in hurry to meet his girlfriend, he wants you to help him in finding out the minimum number of operations he will need. Also he wants you to print one of the possible modified string too.\nInput\n\nFirst line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. \nFor each test case, there are two lines. \nFirst line contains two space separated integers n, k as defined in the problem. \nNext line contains string s of size n.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print two lines.\nFirst line should contain an integer corresponding to minimum number of operations Devu needs.\nIn second line, print one of the possible modified strings.\n\nConstraints\n\nSubtask #1: 20 points\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 20, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 k \xe2\x89\xa4 n\n\n\n\nSubtask #2: 35 points\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 102, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 103, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 k \xe2\x89\xa4 n\n\n\n\nSubtask #3: 45 points\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 105, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 k \xe2\x89\xa4 n\nSum of n over all the test cases is \xe2\x89\xa4 106 \n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 1\n11\n2 2\n11\n4 1\n1001\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n10\n0\n11\n2\n1010\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: As 1 is occurring twice consecutively, we can convert 11 to 10 in a single operation.\nExample case 2: You don't need to modify the string as it does not have more than 2 equal consecutive character.\nExample case 3: As 0 is occurring twice consecutively, we can convert 1001 to 1010 in a two operations (Flip third and fourth character).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin2\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DEVSTR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Two pointers\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1892\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-02-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
