b"\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nDr. Chef is treating COVID-19 patients. There is a queue of NN patients (numbered from patient 11 at the front of the queue to patient NN at the back) outside his clinic. You, his assistant, found out that for each valid ii, the ii-th patient has an illness level AiAi.\nChef treats patients based on their health, i.e. a patient with a higher illness level is always treated before any patients with a lower illness level. Chef is also fair, so he treats patients with an equal illness level based on their position in the queue, i.e. a patient ahead in the queue is always treated before a patient with the same illness level that is further behind in the queue.\nThe first patient to be treated has to wait an hour for Chef to set up his equipment. Treating each patient also takes an hour, and Chef always starts treating the next patient as soon as he is done with the current one.\nThe patients are a bit impatient. As Chef's assistant, for each patient, find out how long (in hours) this patient needs to wait before Chef starts treating this patient.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these integers should be the time the ii-th patient needs to wait.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa451\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41,000 for each valid ii\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n5\n2 3 5 3 4\n3\n2 2 2\n6\n2 10 3 3 2 10\n4\n8 9 8 9\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5 3 1 4 2\n1 2 3\n5 1 3 4 6 2\n3 1 4 2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Patient number 33 has the highest illness level. Therefore, this patient just waits an hour for Chef to set up his equipment and gets treated immediately after. Patient number 55 has the next highest illness level, so they go next. They need to wait an hour for patient 33 to be treated. In total, patient 55 has to wait 22 hours. After that, both patients 22 and 44 have an equal illness level, but patient 22 is ahead in the queue, so patient 22 goes next, followed by patient 44, and then finally patient 11.\nExample case 2: All three patients have the same illness level, so they are treated according to their position in the queue. Patient 11 goes first, followed by patient 22, and then patient 33.\nExample case 3: Patients at positions 22 and 66 in the queue have the highest illness level 1010. The patient at position 22 is ahead in the queue, so this patient is treated first, and then the patient at position 66 is treated. After this, the patients at positions 33 and 44 in the queue have the next highest illness level, so the patient at position 33 is treated next, followed by the patient at position 44. Similarly, afterwards, the patient at position 11 is treated, and then the patient at position 55 is treated.\nExample case 4: Patients at positions 22 and 44 in the queue have the highest illness level 99, so the patient at position 22 is treated first, followed by the patient at position 44, then the patient at position 11 and finally the patient at position 33.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nakash_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFPAT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1742\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
