He took a row of $N$ cells (numbered $1$ through $N$) and placed some objects in some of these cells. You are given a string $S$ with length $N$ describing them; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of $S$ is one of the following:\n\n'I' if the $i$-th cell contains a piece of iron\n'M' if the $i$-th cell contains a magnet\n'_' if the $i$-th cell is empty\n':' if the $i$-th cell contains a conducting sheet\n'X' if the $i$-th cell is blocked\n\nIf there is a magnet in a cell $i$ and iron in a cell $j$, the attraction power between these cells is $P_{i,j} = K+1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}$, where $S_{i,j}$ is the number of cells containing sheets between cells $i$ and $j$. This magnet can only attract this iron if $P_{i, j} \\gt 0$ and there are no blocked cells between the cells $i$ and $j$.\nChef wants to choose some magnets (possibly none) and to each of these magnets, assign a piece of iron which this magnet should attract. Each piece of iron may only be attracted by at most one magnet and only if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. Find the maximum number of magnets Chef can choose.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.\nThe second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron.\nConstraints\n\n$1 \\le T \\le 2,000$\n$1 \\le N \\le 10^5$\n$0 \\le K \\le 10^5$\n$S$ contains only characters 'I', 'M', '_', ':' and 'X'\nthe sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^6$\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): there are no sheets, i.e. $S$ does not contain the character ':'\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4 5\nI::M\n9 10\nMIM_XII:M\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The attraction power between the only magnet and the only piece of iron is $5+1-3-2 = 1$. Note that it decreases with distance and the number of sheets.\nExample case 2:\nThe magnets in cells $1$ and $3$ can attract the piece of iron in cell $2$, since the attraction power is $10$ in both cases. They cannot attract iron in cells $6$ or $7$ because there is a wall between them.\nThe magnet in cell $9$ can attract the pieces of iron in cells $7$ and $6$; the attraction power is $8$ and $7$ respectively.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85a_coder_hack\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FEMA2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Queues, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1725\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-10-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
