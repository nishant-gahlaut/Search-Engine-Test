b'\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nThere are N chefs (numbered 1 through N) and M dishes (numbered 1 through M). For each valid i, the i-th chef can cook dishes of exactly one type Fi. Also, each chef is a friend of K different chefs.\nWhenever some chef cooks a dish, he asks all chefs who either are his friends or know how to cook this dish to evaluate the dish. No chef may evaluate his own dish.\nAll the chefs are arranged in a row from chef 1 to chef N. Chefina is going to choose two valid integers L and R and allow the chefs L,L+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,R to cook their dishes and have them evaluated as described above. She wants to choose L and R in such a way that each of the N chefs evaluates at least one dish. Find the number of such pairs.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and K.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers F1,F2,\xe2\x80\xa6,FN.\nN lines follow. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the i-th of these lines contains K space-separated integers D1,D2,\xe2\x80\xa6,DK denoting the friends of the i-th chef.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of pairs such that each chef evaluates at least one dish.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa43\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Fi\xe2\x89\xa4M for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Di\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\ni\xc2\xa0!=Di for each valid i\nD1,D2,\xe2\x80\xa6,DK are pairwise disticnt\nthe sum of N\xe2\x8b\x85(K+1) over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 3 1\n1 2 3\n3\n3\n1\n6 2 1\n1 1 1 2 2 2\n2\n1\n4\n3\n6\n5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n9\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85rishup_nitdgp\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFPRTY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Lazy Propagation, Two pointers\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Segment Trees, Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2831\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-08-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
