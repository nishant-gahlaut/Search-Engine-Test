When the robot follows the command, it\'ll fall off, so it is unsafe.\n\n\nFor the second case, we can place the robot on the bottom right grid square. Here is an image denoting the moves that the robot will make.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85lg5293\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85errichto\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ROBOTG\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, ad-hoc, Brute Force\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-03-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
