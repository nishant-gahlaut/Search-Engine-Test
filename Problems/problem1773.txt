Determine if it's possible to split it into two nonempty subsequences with equal weights.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line will contain T, the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N \xe2\x88\x92 the length of the permutation.\nThe second line of each test case contains N integers P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN \xe2\x88\x92 the permutation.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, if it's possible to split the permutation into two nonempty subsequences with equal weight, output YES. Otherwise, output NO.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\nThe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4N\nPi\xe2\x89\xa0Pj for i\xe2\x89\xa0j\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n6\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n6\n1 4 2 5 3 6\n8\n5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4\n9\n5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\nExplanation of test case 1: We can split the permutation into two subsequences [1,3,4] and [2,5,6], both of which have 3 prefix maximums. \nExplanation of test case 2: No matter how we split, both sequences will be increasing, therefore the sum of their weights will be 7, so they can't be equal.\nExplanation of test case 3: One way to split is into [1,4,2] and [5,3,6]. 1,4 are prefix maximums of the first sequences, and 5,6 of the second one.\nExplanation of test case 4: One way to split is into [5,6,7,8] and [1,2,3,4]. Both have 4 prefix maximums.\nExplanation of test case 5: It's possible to show that the required split does not exist.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ntrygub_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EQPRFMAXSPLT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 medium, snckfl21, snckfp21, trygub_adm\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-01-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
