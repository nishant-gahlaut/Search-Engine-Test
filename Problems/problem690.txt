b"\nThere are N players standing in a line, indexed 1 to N from left to right. They all play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Each player has already decided which move they want to play. You are given this information as a string S of length N, i.e,\n\nSi is equal to R if player i will play Rock.\nSi is equal to P if player i will play Paper.\nSi is equal to S if player i will play Scissors.\n\nLet W(i,j) denote the move played by the winner if players i,i+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,j compete in order from left to right. That is, \n\nFirst, players i and i+1 play a game\nThe winner of this game plays against player i+2\nThe winner of the second game plays against player i+3\n\n\xe2\x8b\xae\n\nThe winner of the first j\xe2\x88\x92i\xe2\x88\x921 games plays against player j, and the move played by the winner of this game is declared to be W(i,j).\n\nIf i=j, then player i is considered to be the winner and W(i,i)=Si.\nYour task is to find the value of W(i,N) for all i from 1 to N.\nNote : \nIf a person with index i and index j (i<j) play against each other, then:\n\nIf Si\xe2\x89\xa0Sj, the winner is decided by classical rules, i.e, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.\nIf Si=Sj, the player with lower index (in this case, i) wins.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N, the number of players.\nThe second line of each test case contains the string S of length N, denoting the moves chosen by the players.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing a string of length N, whose i-th character is W(i,N).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\nSi is either R, P or S\nSum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask 1 (10 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45000\nSum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 5000\n\nSubtask 2 (90 points):\n\nOriginal constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\nS\n4\nSSPR\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nS\nRRPR\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1. W(1,1)=S as there is only one player.   \nTest Case 2.\nFor W(1,4) the game is played as follows  :\n\nPlayer 1 and 2 compete, player 1 wins.\nPlayer 1 and 3 compete, player 1 wins.\nPlayer 1 and 4 compete, player 4 wins.\n\nHence, we print W(1,4)=S4=R\nFor W(3,4) the game is played as follows  :\n\nPlayer 3 and 4 compete, player 3 wins.\n\nHence, we print W(3,4)=S3=P\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsuryaprak_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ROPASCI\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Maps, Hashmaps, Bottom-up, Sorting, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, DP Approach\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-12-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
