b'\nAbhishek is very good in mathematics. Now he came to know about dot product of vectors. So He asked his friend Suyash a problem. He gave him two vectors A and B of length N . He asked him to minimize the dot product of these two vectors. Suyash has a choice to change the order of the elements of these two vectors i.e. for any two elements i\n and j in any vector he can interchange the position of these elements.\nSince Suyash is new to programming, He asked you to solve this problem for him.\xc2\xa0\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the length of the vectors.\n The second  and third lines contain N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN and B1, B2, ..., BN denoting the elements of the vectors respectively.\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the minimum dot product.\n\nConstraints\nShould contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have.
