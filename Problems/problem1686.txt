b'\nThere is a regular n-gon. Some points are marked on each of its sides. There are x1 point marked on the first side, x2 \xe2\x80\x93 on the second, \xe2\x80\xa6, xn \xe2\x80\x93 on the nth. The marked points do not coincide with the vertices of the n-gon. You can choose no more than one of the marked points from each side and form a convex non-degenerate polygon by connecting all those points with lines. Now your task is to find the number of different k-gons that can be formed that way.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input file contains positive integer t \xe2\x80\x93 the amount of test cases. Next t lines contain six integers each: n, k, a, b, c, m. Here n is the number of sides of the initial n-gon. The amount of marked points on the first side of this n-gon is x1 = a, the amount of the marked points on the following sides is xi = (b*xi-1 + c) mod m, for i > 1.\n\nConstraints\n1 <= t <= 30\n3 <= n <= 109\n3 <= k <= 20\n1 <= b, c, m <= 106\n0 <= a < m\n\nOutput\nFor each test case output the number of k-gons that can be formed modulo 1000000007.\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n4 3 1 2 2 191\n10 5 1 113 157 999991\n\nOutput:\n1228\n328836201\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85ivan_adm\n\n\nTester:\n5\xe2\x98\x85innocentboy\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SWARM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Combinatorics, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2211\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-04-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.25919 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
