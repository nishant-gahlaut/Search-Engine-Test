b"\nLittle Elephant from Zoo of Lviv likes medians so much. Let us define median term for some array A. Let B be the same array A, but sorted in non-decreasing order. Median of A is Bm (1-based indexing), where m equals to (n div 2)+1. Here 'div' is an integer division operation. So, for a sorted array with 5 elements, median is the 3rd element and for a sorted array with 6 elements, it is the 4th element.\n\nLittle Elephant has an array A with n integers. In one turn he can apply the following operation to any consecutive subarray A[l..r]: assign to all Ai (l <= i <= r) median of subarray A[l..r].\n\nLet max be the maximum integer of A. Little Elephant wants to know the minimum number of operations needed to change A to an array of n integers each with value max.\n\nFor example, let A = [1, 2, 3]. Little Elephant wants to change it to [3, 3, 3]. He can do this in two operations, first for subarray A[2..3] (after that A equals to [1, 3, 3]), then operation to A[1..3].\n\nInput\nFirst line of the input contains single integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow, each of such format: first line - integer n, second line - array A consisted of n integers.\n\nOutput\nIn T lines print the results for each test case, one per line.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <= 100\n\n1 <= n <= 30\n\n1 <= A[i] <= 10^9\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n2 1 1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85witaliy_adm\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85subra\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MEDIAN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DP Bitmask, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2023\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-12-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.339965 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
