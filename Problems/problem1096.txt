b"\nAdreja was bored of playing PUBG and asked her grandfather Aurobindo for assigning her any interesting task. Being a Bengali, Aurobindo said \xe2\x80\x9cCode Koroo Naaa\xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d (which means do coding). She then decided to write a code for generating random strings containing uppercase and lowercase English alphabets (i.e. a\xe2\x88\x92zA\xe2\x88\x92Za\xe2\x88\x92zA\xe2\x88\x92Z).\nShe wrote the code and generated NN strings randomly using her code and showed them to Aurobindo. Aurobindo was impressed by her coding abilities, so he gifted her a plate of rosogolla. Her younger brother Nishit also wanted to have rosogolla from Aurobindo. To impress Aurobindo, Nishit decided to tell him which string is palindrome. But, Nishit has learnt about the English alphabets recently, and knows the lowercase representations of all alphabets, but he knows uppercase representations of only KK alphabets. Thus, he considers the other uppercase alphabets to be different alphabets from their lowercase representations. For Example, if he knows both the representations of only 11 alphabet, say \xe2\x80\xb2m\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2m\xe2\x80\xb2, then he will consider \xe2\x80\xb2m\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2m\xe2\x80\xb2 and \xe2\x80\xb2M\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2M\xe2\x80\xb2 to be the same, but for other 2525 alphabets he will consider both of its representations, like \xe2\x80\xb2b\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2b\xe2\x80\xb2 and \xe2\x80\xb2B\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2B\xe2\x80\xb2 as two different alphabets.\nYou are Adreja's best friend, and to test your coding abilities she has asked you to write a program that prints the probability that a string of given length generated by her code will be identified as a palindrome by Nishit. She further told you that it can be proved that the required probability can be represented in the form P/QP/Q where PP and QQ are co-prime integers.Thus, she wants the required probability as P.Q\xe2\x88\x921mod(109+7)P.Q\xe2\x88\x921mod(109+7), where Q\xe2\x88\x921Q\xe2\x88\x921 denotes the modular multiplicative inverse of Q(Q(modulo (109+7))(109+7)).\nINPUT\n\nFirst line of Input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. TT test cases follow.\nFirst line of each test case contains two integers NN and KK, denoting the total number of generated strings and the number of uppercase alphabets known to Nishit. NN more lines follow.\nithith line (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N)(1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N) contains a single integer LiLi representing the length of ithith string.\n\nOUTPUT\n\nFor each test case print NN lines, here the ithith line  (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N)(1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N) should contain single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the required probability for the ithith string in the form specified by Adreja.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4500001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Li\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Li\xe2\x89\xa4109\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4260\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa426\n\nSUBTASKS\n\nSubtask #1 (20 Points): K=0K=0\nSubtask #2 (80 Points): Original Constraints\n\nSAMPLE INPUT\n2\n2 26\n1\n2\n1 1\n3\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\n1\n576923081\n818786988\n\nEXPLANATION\nExample Case 1: Here N=2N=2, so Adreja has generated 22 strings, and K=26K=26, hence Nishit can match all lowercase alphabets to the corresponding uppercase alphabets.\n\nFirst string is of length 11, and any string of length 11 is a palindrome, so the probability of string being a palindrome is 11.\nSecond string is of length 22. Adreja's code can generate 27042704 different strings of length 22. Out of these 27042704 strings, 104104 will be identified as palindromes by Nishit.\n\nExample Case 2: Here N=1N=1, hence only 11 string has been generated.\n\nFor this string, the values of PP and QQ come out to be 2727 and 13521352 respectively, hence P.Q\xe2\x88\x921mod(109+7)=818786988P.Q\xe2\x88\x921mod(109+7)=818786988\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85mayureshpatle\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CODEKARO\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 basic, chptrs01, combinatorics, easy, mayureshpatle, modular-inv, palindrome, probability\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-03-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
