b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n\nYou are playing a game with a deck of r red cards and b blue cards.\nYou are also given p red tokens and r+b-p blue tokens. (0 \xe2\x89\xa4 p \xe2\x89\xa4 r+b).\n\n\nYou will now play a game with r+b turns.\nOn the i-th turn, you choose one of your tokens, then choose a random card from the deck uniformly at random.\nYou earn a point if the color of the token matches the color of the card.\nOtherwise, your score doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change.\nAfterwards, both the token and the card will get discarded.\n\n\nCompute the expected value of your score, assuming you play optimally.\nNote, it is allowed to adjust your strategy based on how many red or blue cards you have seen in previous turns.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input will contain an integer T, the number of test cases.\n\n\nThe only line of each test case will contain three space separated integers r, b, p.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single floating point value, the expected score you will get assuming you play optimally in a new line.\nYour answer will be accepted if it has absolute or relative error at most 10-6.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 r, b \xe2\x89\xa4 100,000\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 p \xe2\x89\xa4 r+b\n\nExample\nInput:\n5\n3 1 2\n1 6 7\n2 3 4\n15 14 13\n100000 100000 0\n\nOutput:\n2.0000000000\n1.0000000000\n2.2000000000\n14.4482758621\n100000.0000000000\n\nExplanation\n\nFor the first case, we have three red cards, one blue card, two red tokens, and two blue tokens.\nAn optimal strategy is to choose the red token first.\nThere are two cases.\nEither the card we choose first is red or blue.\nIf it is blue, then we know for sure all remaining cards will be red, so it doesn't matter how we play the remaining tokens.\nThis gives us 1 point.\nIf it is red, then we will next play our last red token.\nWe can check that the expected value of our score is equal to 2, and there is no other strategy that is strictly better. \n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85lg5293\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85errichto\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CARDS777\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Expected Value\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Probability\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-03-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
