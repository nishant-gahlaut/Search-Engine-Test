b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nSerega is an avid traveller. He has already visited numerous exotic places, and now wants to embark on a journey to Treeland. There are N cities in Treeland that Serega wants to visit. Also, roads have been laid between some N-1 pairs of cities in Treeland. Roads are bidirectional, and there exists a unique path between any two Treeland cities.\n\nEach of Treeland's roads has its own class, wich is specified using a single digit. Serega's journey is a path between some cities, i.e. he never visits one city more than once. But Serega wants to select a path such that the sequence of classes on the path is a palindrome. Of course, Serega wants to visit as many cities as possible. Please help Him.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each case contains a single integer N. The next N-1 lines contain the roads. Each line contains three integers v, u and c, meaning that there is a road of class c between the vth and uth (assuming 1-indexing) cities of Treeland.\nOutput\nFor each test case, you should output the maximum number of cities that Serega can visit.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 3*105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\nSum of N over all test cases in a single file will not be greater then 3*105\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 c \xe2\x89\xa4 9\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 u, v \xe2\x89\xa4 N\nThe roads form a tree.\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (15 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 102 \nSubtask #2: (85 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105 \n\n \n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n8\n1 2 1\n1 3 0\n3 4 1\n4 5 2\n1 6 0\n6 7 1\n7 8 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nExplanation\nSequence of classes on the path between the cities 5 and 8 is 210012.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85gomelfk\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/WAYPA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 binary-search, centroid-decomposition, dec15, gomelfk, hard, hashing\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3062\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-11-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
