b"\n Read problems statements in  Mandarin Chinese  and  Russian.\nChef has a rooted tree, consisting of N vertexes. Each tree vertex has a unique index (integer from 1 to N), and also has a color (black or white).\nThe root of Chef's tree has index 1.\nInitially, all vertexes of the tree are colored white. Then Chef start playing with the tree. He writes out a sequence of \nM vertexes of the tree V1, V2, ..., VM. And now he wants to make M operations with the tree, each of them is:\n\n\nDuring i-th operation Chef picks vertex Vi.\nIf vertex Vi is black, then he colors it white.\nChef finds the farthest white vertex from vertex Vi, in case of tie he picks the one with largest index. This vertex is the result of current operation.\nIf vertex Vi wasn't recolored on step 2 of current operation (therefore before the operation it is white), Chef colors it black.\n\n\nChef gives to you the tree and sequence V. Help him to make all the operations. So, print the index of resulting vertex for each operation.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers N, M - the number of vertexes of the tree and the number of operations. \nThe second line contains N-1 integers P2, P3, ..., PN - description of Chef's tree. \nInteger Pi denotes the index of vertex that is parent of the vertex i in the tree.\nEach of the next M lines contains the description of operations, i-th of them contains integer Vi.\nIt is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.\n\nOutput\nFor each operation of each test case print the index of resulting vertex on the separate line.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 1000,\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 200000,\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 200000,\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Pi, Vi \xe2\x89\xa4 N;\nSum of all N values for test cases is not greater than 200000.\nSum of all M values for test cases is not greater than 200000.\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n6 7\n3 1 3 4 4\n1\n5\n6\n1\n3\n5\n2\n2 2\n1\n2\n1\n\nOutput:\n6\n2\n2\n4\n4\n2\n5\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85gerald\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GERALD2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Segment Trees, HLD\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2808\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-10-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
