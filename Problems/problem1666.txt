b"\nTanya still loves cats, even after all the sufferings she's been through because of them. After rigorously training the batch, it's now time to fit them into the squad. The chosen rookie cats are now to become officers! It's a day of celebration for NCPD, and without any doubt, the most happy person today is Tanya. After all, she is the one who took all the pains to train all of the rookies and transformed them into skilled cats for NCPD, that really is a lot of hard work on her part, so kudos to her for that!\nNow, there are N officers currently in the squad, and Tanya has trained a total of Q rookie cats which have to be accommodated into the squad. At NCPD, each cat is assigned an integer ID, which describes the worthiness of a cat, greater is better. The N cats already in the squad have IDs described by the sequence A.\nAlthough Tanya is the one who has worked the hardest to train these Q cats, but she respects the amount of efforts put by all of her trainees. And out of joy, she has decided to gift rewards to her trainees. There are a total of Q rounds, and in each round a cat with an ID has to be accommodated into A. This is how the accommodation process happens for each cat at NCPD:\n\nTanya gifts a non-negative integer reward to this cat. The amount of reward is actually the number of cats already in A which have a worthiness strictly lesser than this cat.\nThis cat gets added into A at the last position.\n\nCan you help Tanya figure out the total amount of rewards that she needs to have in order to give it to her loved trainees?\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer N.\nThe second line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nThe third line contains an integer Q\nEach of the next Q lines contain an integer X (X=W\xe2\x8a\x95R), where X is the bitwise XOR of the worthiness W of the current cat entering into the squad and the amount of rewards R given so far (excluding the current cat's reward).\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case print a single line containing a single integer, the total amount of reward Tanya needs to give.\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109, for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4W\xe2\x89\xa4109\nAll cats (new and old) have unique worthiness\n\nSubtasks:\n\n30 points: 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4100\n70 points: original constraints\n\nSample Input:\n1\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n5\n6\n2\n3\n27\n16\n\nSample Output:\n35\n\nExplanation:\n\nExample Case 1: Each of the Q accommodations can be seen as follows:\nA=[1,2,3,4,5],\xc2\xa0X=6\xe2\x8a\x950=6\nA=[1,2,3,4,5,6],\xc2\xa0X=7\xe2\x8a\x955=2\nA=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],\xc2\xa0X=8\xe2\x8a\x9511=3\nA=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],\xc2\xa0X=9\xe2\x8a\x9518=27\nA=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],\xc2\xa0X=10\xe2\x8a\x9526=16\nFinally, A becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] and total rewards given are 35.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85ankushkhanna\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DWW19G\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ankushkhanna, ankushkhanna, dwwu2019, fenwick-tree, medium, online-query, policy-based-data-structure, segment-tree\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-12-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 - 3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
