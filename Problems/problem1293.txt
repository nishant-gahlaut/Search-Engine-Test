b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nThis time, Chef has given you an array A containing N elements.\nHe had also asked you to answer M of his questions. Each question sounds like: "How many inversions will the array A contain, if we swap the elements at the ith and the jth positions?". \nThe inversion is such a pair of integers (i,j) that i<j and Ai>Aj. \nInput\n\nThe first line contains two space separated integers N and M - the number of integers in the array A and the number of questions respectively. \nThe second line contains N space-separated integers - A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN, respectively. \nEach of next M lines describes a question by two integers i and j - the 1-based indices of the numbers we\'d like to swap in this question. \n\nOutput\nOutput M lines. Output the answer to the ith question of the ith line.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\nMind that we don\'t actually swap the elements, we only answer "what if" questions, so the array doesn\'t change after the question.\n\nExample Input\n6 3\n1 4 3 3 2 5\n1 1\n1 3\n2 5\n\nExample Output:\n5\n6\n0\n\nExplanation\nInversions for the first case: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5). \nInversions for the second case: (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2,5), (4, 5). \nIn the third case the array looks like 1 2 3 3 4 5 and there are no inversions. \n\n\n\nAuthor:\nberezin\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFINV\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Merge Sort Tree, Fenwick Trees\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2329\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-03-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
