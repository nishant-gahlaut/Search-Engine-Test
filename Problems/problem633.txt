He wants to divide it into K parts (subgraphs) for some integer K.\nFirst, Chef divides the vertices in the graph into K sets such that each vertex belongs to exactly one set; the subgraphs and sets are numbered 1 through K such that for each valid i, vertices from the i-th set belong to the i-th subgraph. Then, Chef checks all the edges in the graph. For an edge connecting vertices u and v, if u and v are both in the i-th set, then this edge belongs to the i-th subgraph. Otherwise, this edge does not belong to any of these K subgraphs.\nAt the end, Chef checks these K subgraphs. If each subgraph contains an even number of edges, then Chef thinks that this way of dividing the graph is delicious.\nChef wants to divide the graph in a delicious way such that K is the smallest possible. Find the minimum K and one such way to divide the graph.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nEach of the next M lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting that vertices u and v are connected by an edge.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print two lines. The first of these lines should contain a single integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum K. The second line should contain N space-separated integers, where for each valid i, the i-th integer denotes the subgraph that vertex i belongs to.\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may output any one.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa43,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4100,000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u\xe2\x89\xa0v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe graph contains no duplicate edges or self-loops\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\nthe sum of M over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 pts): 2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410\nSubtask #2 (70 pts): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5 5\n1 2\n1 3\n2 3\n2 4\n3 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1 2 1 1 2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Subgraph 1 contains vertices 1, 3, 4 and edges (1,3) and (3,4).
