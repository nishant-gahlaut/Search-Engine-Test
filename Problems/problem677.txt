In one such dream, Mario is given an array a of length n, and a number k. He performs as many operations as he wants to this array; in the end, he wants to make every element divisible by k.\nIn a single operation, Mario selects two indices i and j (in particular, he can choose i=j), and does a[i]=a[i]+a[j].\nHelp Mario decide if he can make everything divisible by k eventually, thus ending his dream.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers n and k.\nThe second line contains n space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,An.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing "YES" if everything can be made divisible by k eventually, and "NO" if not.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nSum of n across all testcases is \xe2\x89\xa4106\n\nSubtasks\n\n30 points: Sum of n across all testcases is \xe2\x89\xa4104\n70 points: Original constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n    3 2\n    3 4 3\n    5 6\n    6 6 8 7 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\n    NO\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: We can make everything divisible by 2 in 2 steps. In the first step, choose i=1,j=1, which gives the array 6 4 3. Then, choose i=3,j=3 which gives the array 6 4 6.\nExample case 2: It is not possible to make everything divisible by 6 through any sequence of moves.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85theoneyouwant\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DREDIV\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-01-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
