b'\n\nSome time ago, Chef discovered that more and more people have started climbing mountains every day.\nSo he decided to build restaurant in the Ukrainian resort Bukovel (Carpathian Mountains). But there are many places to choose, so he wants to choose the best one. Let us learn how attractiveness for a location is calculated.\n\nNext to every place, is some mountain. A Mountain is a sequence of points (0,height0), (1,height1), ... (n-1,heightn-1), where every two adjacent points are connected with a segment. For example, consider the mountain\n(0,0), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2), (4,1), (5,3), (6,0), (7,1), (8,0)\n\n       /\\\n  /\\/\\/  \\\n /        \\/\\\n\n\n\nVisitors may start their climbing from some position i and finish in position j, where (i < j).They calculate the attractiveness of a mountain, as the number of different climbs that it offers. Of course, so does our Chef!\n\nA climb from position i to position j is the sequence (i,heighti), ... (j,heightj).Two climbs, say i1 to j1 and i2 to j2, are different if and only if\n(j1 \xe2\x80\x93 i1 != j2 \xe2\x80\x93 i2) orheighti1+k \xe2\x80\x93 heighti1+k-1 != heighti2+k \xe2\x80\x93 heighti2+k\xe2\x80\x931 for at least some k in the range (1, 2, ... j1-i1).\n\nLet us consider two climbs from the mountain we considered above\n\n  /\\/\n /\n\nand\n\n  /\\\n /  \\\n     \\\n\n\n\nThe first one is the climb from (0 to 3), and the second one is the climb from (4 to 6). They are different because (3 - 0 != 6 - 4). On the other hand, climbs such as (0 to 1) and (4 to 5) are the same.\n\nGiven the array, heights, find the number of different climbs that exist on the mountain which is described by the sequence of these heights. Because answer can be very large, output it modulo 1,000,000,009.\nInput\n\nFirst line of input contains T, the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains N, the number of peaks. On second line of each test case, there are N numbers. The ith number denotes the height of ith peak.\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single number, the number of unique climbs.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10001 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100000Sum of N over all test cases in a file \xe2\x89\xa4 100000|Heighti| \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000|Heighti \xe2\x80\x93 Heighti-1| \xe2\x89\xa4 100 (Tourists won\xe2\x80\x99t climb very steep cliffs)\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n6\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n9\n0 2 1 2 1 3 0 1 0\n7\n0 5 -5 5 -5 4 -4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n31\n20\n\n\nExplanation\n\nThe second test case is taken from the problem statement.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nvitalij_adm\n\n\nTester:\n1\xe2\x98\x85gamabunta\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MOU1H\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Suffix Automaton, Suffix Arrays, Longest Common Prefix\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Suffix Structures, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, DP on sequences\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2116\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-03-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
