b'\nChef has opened a new ice cream parlor. His friend Chefina is going to visit the parlor very soon. Chef knows that Chefina is going to order a triple sundae on her visit. However, he does not know which flavors she would order.\nChef has three storage containers with capacities X,YX,Y and Z respectively. Each container can store multiple flavors of ice cream. Since Chef does not know which flavors Chefina would order, he wants to store maximum number of flavors in the storage containers. \nChef has a total of N flavors. In order to store the ith flavor, Chef must select exactly one container and fill it with Ci amount of flavor i. \nNote that the total amount of ice cream filled in a container should not exceed its capacity.\nFind the maximum number of flavors Chef can store in the containers.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line will contain T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains four integers N,X,Y and Z.\nThe next line contains N integers, where the ith integer denotes Ci.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line the maximum number of distinct flavors Chef can store using the three containers.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4200\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X,Y,Z\xe2\x89\xa41500\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa41500\nSum of N overall test cases does not exceed 2000.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5 12 16 15\n11 8 5 10 9\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: \n\nStore flavor {4} in container X, since 10\xe2\x89\xa4|X|.  \nStore flavors {1,3} in container Y, since (11+5)=16\xe2\x89\xa4|Y|.\nStore flavors {5} in container Z, since 9\xe2\x89\xa4|Z|. \nThis way we can store 4 flavors.\n\nThere can be other ways to store 4 flavours but we cannot store more than 4 flavours.\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5 4 5 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 2:\n\nStore flavor {4} in container X, since 4\xe2\x89\xa4|X|=4.\nStore flavors {2,3} in container Y, since 2+3=5\xe2\x89\xa4|Y|=5.\nStore flavors {5} in container Z, since 5\xe2\x89\xa4|Z|=5. \nThis way we can store 4 flavors.\n\nIt can be proven that we cannot store more than 4 flavors in this case.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85sg1729\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TPT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 bitset, dynamic-programming, medium, sg1729, start29\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3274\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-12-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
