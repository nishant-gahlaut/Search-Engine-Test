b'\nSita went to buy some crackers. They offered special discount for the ones who solve a puzzle. Sita could not solve it, she came to you for help. Following is the puzzle.\nA mapping "a->b" means that you can transform letter \'a\' to letter \'b\'. You are given M such mappings.\nYou are given two strings S and T. \nWrite a program which determines if S can be transformed to T using the provided mappings.\nYou can select any position in S and apply any of the M mappings on it. You can do this any number of times. Each mapping can be used any number of times.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer P denoting the number of test cases.\nFirst line of each test case has the string S. Second line of each test case has the string T\nThird line of each test case has M. Following M lines describes the mappings, one per line.\nOutput\nFor each test case output one line, print "YES" if it is possible to transfrom S to T. print "NO" if not possible.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 P \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |S|, |T| \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\nS and T contain lower case English alphabet only\nAll mappings are from lower case English alphabet to lower case English alphabet\nLength of S and T need not be equal.\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\naa\nbb\n1\na->b\nab\nba\n2\na->b\nb->a\na\nb\n1\nb->a\nOutput:\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\nExplanation\nTest case #1:\nClearly \'a\' can be transformed to \'b\'. So "aa" can be transformed to "bb"\n\nTest case #2:\n\'a\' can be transformed to \'b\' by using mapping 1. \'b\' can be transformed to \'a\' by using mapping 2\nTest case #3:\n\'b\' can be transformed to \'a\' but \'a\' cannot be transformed to \'b\'. So it is not possible.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ACM14KG3\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 acmkg14r, admin, easy, floyd-warshall\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-10-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nJAVA, C, CPP14, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
