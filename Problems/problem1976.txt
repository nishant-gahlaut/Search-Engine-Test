b"\nConsider a positive integer N. Denote its decimal digits by X1, X2,..., XK. N is called a Cool Number if you can select at most three (but at least one) of its digits such that the following number is divisible by N:\n\n(X1 + X2 + ... + XK \xe2\x80\x93 S)S\n\nwhere S is the sum of the selected digits.\nLet LC(N) be the largest Cool Number which is not greater than N, and UC(N) be the smallest Cool Number which is greater than N. So the following inequalities hold\n LC(N) \xe2\x89\xa4 N < UC(N).\nYour task is to find for the given positive integer N the values of LC(N) and UC(N). As you will see from the examples LC(N) and UC(N) exist for every positive integer N.\nConsider some examples.\n\n1458 is a Cool Number since ((1 + 4 + 5 + 8) \xe2\x80\x93 (1 + 5))1 + 5 = 126 = 2985984 is divisible by 1458. Note that here we select two digits: 1 and 5.\n\nAll numbers of the form 10n (n = 0, 1, 2, ...) are Cool. Indeed, if we select just one digit 1 (the first digit of 10n) in the definition of Cool Number we obtain the number (1 + 0 + ... + 0 \xe2\x80\x93 1)1 = 01 = 0 and it is divisible by 10n (recall that 0 is divisible by every positive integer). Now consider some positive integer N of n digits. Then, clearly, 10n-1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N < 10n where both 10n-1 and 10n are Cool Numbers. Hence LC(N) and UC(N) always exist and, moreover, LC(N) \xe2\x89\xa5 10n-1 and UC(N) \xe2\x89\xa4 10n.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input file contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contains a positive integer N.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case output on a single line values of LC(N) and UC(N) separated by a single space.\n\nConstraints \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 101000\nThe total number of digits in all numbers N in the input file does not exceed 4000000.\n\nExample\nInput:\n4\n2\n999\n1459\n18898888\n\nOutput:\n2 3\n999 1000\n1458 1460\n18895680 18900000\n\nExplanation\nCase 1. The number 2 is the largest integer which is not greater than N = 2, the number 3 is the smallest integer which is greater than N = 2, and they both are Cool Numbers, which can be shown similar to the case of 10n in the example above.\nCase 2. It is very similar to the first test case and we already know that 1000 is a Cool Number. So we just have to show that 999 is a Cool number. But it is clear, since we can select all the three digits so ((9 + 9 + 9) \xe2\x80\x93 (9 + 9 + 9))9 + 9 + 9 = 027 = 0 which is divisible by 999.\nUnfortunately, we can't provide you with the explanation of the third and the fourth test cases. You should figure it out by yourself. Please, don't ask about this in comments.\nWarning!\nThere are large input and output files in this problem. Make sure you use fast enough I/O methods.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n1\xe2\x98\x85istva_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85anton_lunyov\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COOLNUM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, Primes\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2713\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-04-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.34426 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n30000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
