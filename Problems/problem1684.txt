b"\nNow its time for the final battle between Eon and Codezilla. There are N weapons available numbered from 1 to N. The cost of weapon i is C[i] (1<=i<=N). There will be M attacks. In each attack Eon will choose K weapons from the range of weapons numbered between L and R (both inclusive). All weapons have the same damage power. Eon wants to spend the minimum amount possible for each attack .Tell Eon the amount that he will need to spend for each attack.\nInput\nFirst line of the input contains an integer N. The next line contains N space separated integers representing the array C representing the cost of the weapons. Next line contains an integer M. Each of the next M lines contains three integers L, R and K.\nOutput\nOutput should consists of M lines. The i'th line should contain the minimum amount that Eon needs to spend for the i'th attack. Since the answer can be large, output the answer modulo 10^9+7.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 20000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 20000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 L \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 R-L+1\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 C[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 10^9\n\nExample\nInput:\n5\n9 3 5 3 1\n2\n1 3 2\n2 5 3\n\nOutput:\n8\n7\nExplanation\nExample case 1. Eon will choose the weapons 2 and 3. So the answer is 3+5=8.\nExample case 2.  Eon will choose the weapons 2, 4 and 5. So the answer is 1+3+3=7\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85tussharsingh13\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CDZ14E\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cdzl14, divide-and-conquer, medium, segment-tree, tussharsingh13\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-02-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.196262 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nJAVA, C, CPP14, PYP3, GO\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
