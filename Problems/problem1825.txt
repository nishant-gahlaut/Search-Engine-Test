b'\nPhoenix has always been partying every weekend until March. Now due to this COVID-19 pandemic his weekends parties are spoiled. Phoenix is a great salsa dancer, he used to judge dance competitions in every weekend party. The judging criteria of Phoenix was very weird. Assume there are N dancers in a group and all dancers had their UNIQUE_ID. Now from each group, one by one N dancers come on the ramp in some order. To make sure nobody gets lost, moderator had set the following rule: "players who have already arrived there should form a circle, and a player who has just arrived there should cut into the circle somewhere"\nPhoenix used to note "Potential" of each individual dancer of a group.\nPotential of a dancer is defined as the Minimum of UNIQUE_ID of clockwise adjacent dancer and Anti-clockwise adjacent dancer. For first dancer assume his Potential as 0, as there are no adjacent dancers.\nEach group wants to win the "Salsa breakers Cup" so they will send their players in such a order that their sum of potential of each player is maximized. Now Phoenix is busy in learning guitar, so you have to virtually judge the competition and decide the winner as Phoenix used to decide before COVID-19.\nYou are given $T$(the number of teams) and for each team you are given $N$(number of dancers in that team) followed by an array containing unique ID of each dancer of that team.\nYou need to predict which team wins the award and print the overall potential of winner team(sum of potential of all members)\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain $T$, number of teams.\nFor each team an integer $N$ is provided, denoting the number of dancers in that team.\nSecond line for each team will contain $N$ integers denoting the potential of that dancer.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print score of the winner team.\nConstraints\n\n$1 \\leq T \\leq 10$\n$1 \\leq N \\leq 2  *  10^5$\n$1 \\leq A_{i}\\leq 10^9$\n\nSample Input:\n    2\n    4\n    1 2 3 3\n    8\n    3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nSample Output:\n    21\n\nEXPLANATION:\nIn first team, arranging the dancers in order of 3,1,3,2 the max potential of 9 is obtained.\nFor second team, we can get the maximum potential as 21.\nSo the team two will win the Salsa Breakers\' Cup.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85nisu29\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CDVNT01D\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cove2020, medium, nisu29, observation\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-07-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, PYPY, kotlin\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
