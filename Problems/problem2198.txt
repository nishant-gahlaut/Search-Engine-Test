b'\n\nChef has called on you many times in the past to solve unusual tasks that\nseem irrelevant to cooking, and today is no different.\nToday Chef demands that you find integers whose product of digits is equal to a given integer,\nbut in bases besides 10.\nGiven a string S, you are to determine the smallest positive integer I such that there\nexists a base B>1 for which the product of the digits of I\ngives the integer represented by S.\nFor example, if S="11", then the smallest I is 8, because the base 3\nrepresentation of I is 22, and in base 3 2*2=11.\n\nFormally, your task is this: find the smallest integer I such that there exists\nan integer B>1 and integers Ai for which:\n\nAn*Bn+An-1*Bn-1+...+A1*B+A0 = I\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai<B for all i\nAn\xe2\x89\xa00\nAn*An-1*...*A1*A0 = \nSm*Bm+Sm-1*Bm-1+...+S1*B1+S0,\nwhere Sm is the leftmost character of S, and S0 is the rightmost character of S.\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Si<B for all i\n\n\nInput\nInput begins with an integer T, the number of test cases (at most 50).\nEach test case consists of a single line containing a string S\ncomprised of 0-9 and A-Z characters.\nCharacters A-Z represent the decimal values 10-35, respectively.  S will have between 1 and 4 characters, and the first character will not be 0.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer on a line, giving the minimum\nvalue of I (printed in decimal).\nIt is guaranteed that I will fit in a 64-bit integer.\nSample Input\n4\n9\n11\n7Q2\nPIES\n\nSample Output\n9\n8\n15227\n7845414\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndavid_adm\n\n\nTester:\nfriggstad\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DIGITS2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cook09, david_adm, hard\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n9999\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-04-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.683301 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
