b'\nA tennis tournament is about to take place with NN players participating in it.\nEvery player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. \nWith Naman\'s birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  \nYour task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains of a single integer NN denoting number of players.\n\nOutput:\n\nIf it\'s impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).\nOtherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print NN lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size NN. \nIf the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between ii and jj , ii wins. \nYou will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.\nYou will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\nSubtasks\n\n10 points : 2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa462\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa46\n90 points :  Original Constraints. \n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\n010\n001\n100\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\nOne such scenario for NN = 33 is when player 11 beats player 22, player 22 to beats player 33 and player 33 beats player 11. Here all players win exactly 11 match. \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85shashwatchandr\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EXUNB\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1503\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-09-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
