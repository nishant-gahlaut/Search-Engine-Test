b'\nRashmi and Mohit are best friends and both topped in their final exams and now their friends want a party from them. Now rashmi decided to play a game with Mohit and the reward for the winner was the winner of the game will not pay a single rupee for the party. Mohit is also a stud boy and agreed to play the game.\nIn this game both are are chosing two different string of same size and they have to calculate the sum of ascii value of their strings.( If the difference between the sum of ascii value of rashmi\xe2\x80\x99s string and sum of ascii value to mohit\xe2\x80\x99s string is  >=1 and <=10). Then "Rashmi" will win the game else "Mohit" will win.\nNote: If ascii value of both strings are same then it will give a tie and no one will win. Both will have to pay the half of the money given in the bill.\nBut here comes the twist as they both are busy for preperation for their next semester so the work to find the winner is given to you. So you have to write a program to find the winner of this game.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains two input lines,i.e two strings S1(Mohit\xe2\x80\xb2sstring),S2(Rashmi\xe2\x80\xb2sstring)S1(Mohit\xe2\x80\xb2sstring),S2(Rashmi\xe2\x80\xb2sstring). \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output a single line i.e winner of the game or if there is no winner in the game print a line "No One" (The Outputs are case sensetive).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4S1,S2\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4S1,S2\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\nSample Input:\n1\nrashi\n\nmohit\nSample Output:\nRashmi\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe sum of ascii value of first string is 535 and sum of ascii value of second string is 545.\nso the winner is Rashmi \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85abhi_3568\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/YAD786\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 abhi_3568, c-plus-plus, easy, strings\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-03-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
