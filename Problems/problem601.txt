b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a calculator which has two screens and two buttons. Initially, each screen shows the number zero. Pressing the first button increments the number on the first screen by 1, and each click of the first button consumes 1 unit of energy.\nPressing the second button increases the number on the second screen by the number which is currently appearing on the first screen. Each click of the second button consumes B units of energy.\nInitially the calculator has N units of energy.\nNow chef wonders what the maximum possible number is, that he gets on the second screen of the calculator, with the limited energy.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nEach test case is described using a single line containing two integers, N and B.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer to this test case.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10,000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, B \xe2\x89\xa4 1,000,000,000\n\n \nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (20 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, B \xe2\x89\xa4 1,000\nSubtask 2 (80 points): Original constraints\n\n \n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n10 2\n8 5\n6 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n12\n3\n9\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. There are 10 units of energy available. Pressing second button takes 2 units of energy. Chef can achieve 12 on the second screen as follows.\n\nPress first button to get scores (1, 0). 9 units of energey is left.\nPress first button to get scores (2, 0). 8 units of energy remaining.\nPress first button to get scores (3, 0). 7 units of energy remaining.\nPress first button to get scores (4, 0). 6 units of energy remaining.\nPress second button to get scores (4, 4). 4 units of energy remaining.\nPress second button to get scores (4, 8). 2 units of energy remaining.\nPress second button to get scores (4, 12). 0 units of energy remaining.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CALC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Arithmetic\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Basic Maths\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1605\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-07-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
