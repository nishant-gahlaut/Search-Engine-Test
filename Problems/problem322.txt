b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nEach month, a CodeChef Long Contest starts at 3 PM IST (UTC+5:30) on the first Friday and it lasts for exactly 1010 days (i.e. 240240 hours). Also, a Cook-Off starts at 9:30 PM IST on the second-to-last (i.e. penultimate) Sunday and it lasts for 2.52.5 hours.\nLet's denote a month by a pair (m,y)(m,y), where mm is one of the twelve months (numbered 11 through 1212) and yy is a year. You are given two (not necessarily distinct) months, e.g. Oct 2009 and Feb 2020. You have to find the total number of months between these two months (both inclusive) when the Long Contest and Cook-Off intersect, i.e. there is a moment in time when both contests for that month are running simultaneously. Here, we assume that both contests are held on each and every month without any interruptions or schedule changes.\nNote: A year is a leap year if it a multiple of 400400, or if it is a multiple of 44 but not a multiple of 100100. For example, the year 21002100 is not a leap year, but the year 24002400 is a leap year.\nAlso Note that you have to assume 7th February, 2020 as Friday, and extrapolate it backwords till Year 1 using the leap year rules mentioned.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers m1m1 and y1y1 describing the first month.\nThe second line contains two space-separated integers m2m2 and y2y2 describing the second month.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of months between (m1,y1)(m1,y1) and (m2,y2)(m2,y2) when the Long Contest and the Cook-Off intersect.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4m1,m2\xe2\x89\xa4121\xe2\x89\xa4m1,m2\xe2\x89\xa412\n1\xe2\x89\xa4y1\xe2\x89\xa4y2\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4y1\xe2\x89\xa4y2\xe2\x89\xa4109\nthe month (m1,y1)(m1,y1) does not come later than (m2,y2)(m2,y2)\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (15 points):\n\nT\xe2\x89\xa4103T\xe2\x89\xa4103\ny2\xe2\x89\xa42,020y2\xe2\x89\xa42,020\n\nSubtask #2 (25 points): y2\xe2\x89\xa4106y2\xe2\x89\xa4106\nSubtask #3 (60 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2 2020\n2 2020\n10 2009\n2 2020\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: On the Contests page, we can see that this month (Feb 2020), the Long Contest starts on the 7th and ends on the 17th, while the Cook-Off takes place on the 16th. Hence, there is one month in the given range where the Long Contest and the Cook-Off intersect.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin3\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LONGCOOK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-02-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
