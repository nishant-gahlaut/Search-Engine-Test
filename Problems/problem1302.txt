b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nYou are given a tree of N nodes numbered from 1 to N. \nThe ith edge connecting node ui and vi has a weight of wi.\n\n\nYour target is to handle the queries of the following two types:\n\n\n"1 i c" : Update the weight of ith edge with the new weight c.  \n  (1 represents the query type). \n\n"2 u v" : Find the length of the path from node u to v. (2 represents the query type).\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer N.\nEach of the next N - 1 lines contains three integers u v w, representing an edge \n  between u and v with the weight of w.\nThe next line contains a single integer Q representing the number of queries\nEach of the next Q lines contains three integers representing a query as described above.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query of type 2, output the answer in a single line.\n\nConstraints\nAll test:\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i < N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 u, v \xe2\x89\xa4 N; u \xe2\x89\xa0 v\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 w, c \xe2\x89\xa4 104\n\n\n40 points:\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, Q \xe2\x89\xa4 103\n\n\n60 points:\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, Q \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n5\n1 2 2\n2 3 4\n4 2 3\n5 4 1\n3\n2 5 3\n1 3 1\n2 5 3\n\nOutput:\n8\n6\n\n\nExplanation\nThe path from 5 to 3 is 5 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3. Initially this path has the length of 1 + 3 + 4 = 8. \nAfter the weight of the edge connect 4 and 2 was changed to 1, the new length of the path is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ntuan_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85stzgd\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TAQTREE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, Square Root Decomposition, HLD, Lowest Common Ancestor, DFS Order\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals, DFS\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2443\n\n\nDate Added:\n6-12-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
