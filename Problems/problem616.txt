b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef Aditi keeps changing the flavours of her dishes and she wants to analyse feedback from her customers in order to improve her performance. The customers visiting Aditi\'s restaurant can rate the food online and Aditi knows an aggregated rating for each day. As she is busy cooking, you should perform the data analysis.\nYou are given a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN of distinct integers denoting the customers\' feedback during N days. You should process Q queries. In each query, you are given two integers L and R. Consider any contiguous subsequence Ap,Ap+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Aq, where L\xe2\x89\xa4p<q\xe2\x89\xa4R; let\'s call it a maximal increasing subsequence if the following conditions hold:\n\nAp<Ap+1\xe2\x80\xa6<Aq\nif p>L, then Ap<Ap\xe2\x88\x921\nif q<R, then Aq>Aq+1\n\nSimilarly, let\'s define a maximal decreasing subsequence. You should find out if the number of maximal increasing subsequences is equal to the number of maximal decreasing subsequences (with L\xe2\x89\xa4p<q\xe2\x89\xa4R).\nFor example, if A=(10,20,30,5), we can see that the only maximal increasing subsequence of this sequence (for L=1 and R=N) is (10,20,30), since (10,20) does not satisfy the third condition and (20,30) does not satisfy the second condition, and there is only one maximal decreasing subsequence (30,5).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and Q.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nQ lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers L and R describing a query.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing the string "YES" if the number of maximal increasing contiguous subsequences is equal to the number of maximal decreasing contiguous subsequences or "NO" otherwise (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4L<R\xe2\x89\xa4N\nA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN are pairwise distinct\n\nSubtasks\nSubtasks #1 (20 points): Q\xe2\x89\xa450\nSubtasks #2 (80 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4 3\n1 3 2 4\n1 4\n2 3\n2 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNO\nNO\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\nFor the first query, there are two maximal increasing subsequences (1,3) and (2,4), but only one maximal decreasing subsequence (3,2).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85sahi1422\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ISBIAS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 1D Arrays, ad-hoc, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1837\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-11-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
