b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has an array A consisting of N integers. He also has an intger K.\nChef wants you to find out number of different arrays he can obtain from array A by applying the following operation exactly K times.\n\nPick some element in the array and multiply it by -1\n\n\n\nAs answer could be quite large, print it modulo 109 + 7.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, K as defined above.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the number of different arrays Chef can get modulo 109 + 7.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, K \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n-106 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (10 points) : N, K \xe2\x89\xa4 10\nSubtask #2 (30 points) : N, K \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nSubtask #3 (60 points) : N, K \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1 3\n100\n3 1\n1 2 1\n3 2\n1 2 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.\nChef has only one element and must apply the operation 3 times to it. After applying the operations, he will end up with -100. That is the only array he will get.\n\nExample case 2.\nChef can apply operation to one of three elements. So, he can obtain three different arrays.\n\nExample case 3.\nNote that other than applying operation to positions (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), Chef can also apply the operation twice on some element and get the original.\n\nIn summary, Chef can get following four arrays.\n[1, 2, 1]\n[-1, -2, 1]\n[-1, 2, -1]\n[1, -2, -1]\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nberezin\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFARK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Combinatorics\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1843\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-10-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
