b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a string S. He also has another string P, called pattern. He wants to find the pattern in S, but that might be impossible. Therefore, he is willing to reorder the characters of S in such a way that P occurs in the resulting string (an anagram of S) as a substring.\nSince this problem was too hard for Chef, he decided to ask you, his genius friend, for help. Can you find the lexicographically smallest anagram of S that contains P as substring?\nNote: A string B is a substring of a string A if B can be obtained from A by deleting several (possibly none or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly none or all) characters from the end.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single string S.\nThe second line contains a single string P.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one string \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest anagram of S that contains P.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4|P|\xe2\x89\xa4|S|\xe2\x89\xa4105\nS and P contain only lowercase English letters\nthere is at least one anagram of S that contains P\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): |S|\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nSubtask #2 (80 points): |S|\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\nakramkeeanany\naka\nsupahotboy\nbohoty\ndaehabshatorawy\nbadawy\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\naaakaeekmnnry\nabohotypsu\naabadawyehhorst\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85triplem5ds\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SKMP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Frequency Arrays, String\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1538\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-07-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
