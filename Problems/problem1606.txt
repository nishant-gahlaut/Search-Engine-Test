b'\nThere is a bit-string S of length N (0- indexed) which can contain only 0s and 1s. Initially, all the bits are 0. Now you have to perform two types of operations:\n1) Flip all the bits between s[x] and s[y] (both inclusive). This is represented by the command "0 x y"\xc2\xa0\n2) Answer how many bits between s[x] and s[y] (both inclusive) are 1. This is represented by the command "1 x y".\n\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains two integer N and Q  denoting the length of the string and the number of queries to be executed respectively. \nEach of the next Q lines are either of the form "0 x y" or "1 x y" as mentioned above.\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nOutput single line for each of the queries of the form "1 x y" containing the required answer for the corresponding query.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N,Q \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 x,y \xe2\x89\xa4 N-1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n4 7\n1 0 3\n0 1 2\n1 0 1\n1 0 0\n0 0 3\n1 0 3 \n1 3 3\n\nOutput:\n0\n1\n0\n2\n1\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85hsagarthegr8\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BITMASK5\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 hsagarthegr8, medium, segment-tree\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-04-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.015 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
