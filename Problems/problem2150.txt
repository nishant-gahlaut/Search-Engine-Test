b'\nGiven three numbers A, B and C all having N digits, little Johnny needs to write a program to permute the digits of the number C so that the new number is greater than both A and B.\nThis problem would be so easy if Johnny\'s teacher didn\'t require that Johnny\'s program must be correct in both the real world and the reversed world. What happens once the world is reversed? One thing Johnny knows for sure is that all the numbers are also reversed. The second thing, the "greater than"  relation becomes the \n"smaller than" relation. \nFor the sake of clarity, we will use aR to denote the number a in the reversed world (for instance, 113R = 311).\nThus Johnny task is now permute the digits of C so that the new number is greater than both A and B. In additional, the reverse of the new number should be smaller than both AR and BR. If there are multiple possible solutions, Johnny needs to find the smallest one.\nAs usual, please help Little Johnny with his task!\n\n\nInput\nThe first line contains a number T (about 10) which is the number of the test cases. Each test case has the following form.\nThe first line contains N (1 <= N <= 1000000).\nThe second line contains the number A.\nThe third line contains the number B.\nThe fourth line contains the number C.\nEach test case\'s input is separated by a blank line.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print the solution in a single line. If there is no solution, print the number -1.\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n\n2\n12\n23\n32\n\n3\n124\n324\n335\n\nOutput:\n-1\n353\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nShankar_IT150\n\n\nTester:\nfriggstad\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/REVERSED\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Shankar_IT150, april10, hard\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2302\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-03-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.26 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
