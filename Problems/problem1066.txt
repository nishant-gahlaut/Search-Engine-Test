b"\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nCollege admissions are starting and Chef has also recently completed his high school. There are NN colleges, numbered from 11 to NN, and they are ranked from 11 to NN. Each college has only a single seat left. To apply for the colleges, every student has to give a common exam, the result of which decides their destiny, i.e, the student having best rank (scoring max marks) gets to choose the college of their preference first. \nEach student has a list of colleges that they like. They will want to get to the best-ranked college from their list. If they can't get into it, they will want to get into the second-ranked college from among their list, and so on.\nIf the single vacant seat of a college gets filled, the admission for that year is closed in that college. Then, the people who have applied for that college have to look for a lower-ranked college in their preference list provided that it still has vacancies.\nGiven information about MM students, about their marks scored in the exam (given as ranks) and the id\xe2\x80\x99s of the college they are applying for, find which college Chef will land into given that he is the student with id=1id=1.\nEvery student tries to get into the highest-ranked college on his list which has a vacancy and if not possible to get into any of the colleges on his list, he won\xe2\x80\x99t join any college this year.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains M+3M+3 lines of input.\nFirst line contains 22 space separated integers NN, MM, the total number of colleges, and total number of students respectively.\nSecond line contain NN distinct space separated integers RiRi, rank of the ithith college. Here 11 denotes a higher rank and NN denotes a lower rank.\nThird line contains MM distinct space separated integers SiSi, the rank of the ithith student in the exam. Here 11 denotes a higher rank, i.e, maximum marks scored and MM denotes a lower rank, i.e, minimum marks scored.\nNext MM lines contain K+1K+1 space separated integers which the first integer KK is the number of colleges ithith student will apply to and the next KK integers describe the same.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the college in which Chef applies and 00 if he won't be joining any college this year.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x88\x971041\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x88\x97104\nRR is the permutation of integers from [1,N][1,N]\nSS is the permutation of integers from [1,M][1,M]\nSum of NN over all tests is atmost 3\xe2\x88\x971053\xe2\x88\x97105\nSum of MM over all tests is atmost 3.5\xe2\x88\x971053.5\xe2\x88\x97105\nSum of KK over all students over all tests is atmost 1.5\xe2\x88\x971061.5\xe2\x88\x97106\nEvery student applies to atleast 11 college and all the applied colleges are different.\n\nNote: Language multiplier for JavaJava is 33 and for pythonpython is 55 and its recommended to use Fast Input-Output for this problem.\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 2\n2 1\n1 2\n2 1 2\n2 1 2\n1 2\n1\n2 1\n1 1\n1 1\n2 1\n1 2\n1\n2 2 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n0\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nCase 1: Here since Chef has the highest rank, he gets to choose the highest rank college in his preference list first, that is college with id=2id=2.\nCase 2: Here since there is only 11 college and Chef stood second, he won't be able to apply to any of the colleges this year, so we print id=0id=0.\nCase 3: Here since Chef is the only student and thus has the highest rank, he gets to choose the highest rank college in his preference list first, that is college with id=1id=1.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ADMIT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Conditional Statements, Basic Maths, Sorting, Brute Force, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Basic Programming Concepts, Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2496\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-02-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
