b"\nSalmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.\nEach rubber duck has a color. There are a total of N+1N+1 colors, numbered from 00 to NN. Salmon wants to place his N\xe2\x88\x97KN\xe2\x88\x97K ducks into NN boxes, each of which can fit KK ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.\nSalmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of 22 distinct colors per box.\nPlease help Salmon achieve this goal!\nIt can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.\nIf there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   \nInput:\n\nThe first line contains an integer TT, denoting the number of testcases. TT testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   \nThe first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.   \nThe second line of each testcase contains N+1N+1  space-separated integers. The i+1i+1-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-ii where 0\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N0\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nOutput:\n\nOutput NN lines for each testcase. \nThe ii-th line of a testcase should contain 44 space-separated integers c1,m1,c2,m2c1,m1,c2,m2 respectively which denotes that that are m1m1 ducks of color-c1c1 and m2m2 ducks of color-c2c2 inside the ii-th box where 0\xe2\x89\xa4m1,m2\xe2\x89\xa4K0\xe2\x89\xa4m1,m2\xe2\x89\xa4K and 0\xe2\x89\xa4c1,c2\xe2\x89\xa4N0\xe2\x89\xa4c1,c2\xe2\x89\xa4N. \nNote that even if you have only one color to put inside the ii-th box, you should still output 44 space-separated integers and keep either m1m1 or m2m2 as 00. And 0\xe2\x89\xa4c1,c2\xe2\x89\xa4N0\xe2\x89\xa4c1,c2\xe2\x89\xa4N.\nThe output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.\n\nConstraints\n\nT=10T=10\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105 \n2\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4105 \nTotal ducks for each test case is exactly N\xe2\x88\x97KN\xe2\x88\x97K\nThere can be a color with 00 ducks\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 [20 points]: 2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4102\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410, K=2K=2 \nSubtask 2 [30 points]: N=2N=2, K=5K=5\nSubtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints\n\nSample Input:\n1\n2 4\n3 4 1\n\nSample Output:\n2 1 1 3\n1 1 0 3\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the given testcase, Salmon has N=2N=2 boxes, each of size K=4K=4 and there are total N\xe2\x88\x97K=8N\xe2\x88\x97K=8 ducks.   \nThe first box is filled with 11 duck of color-22 and 33 ducks of color-11 and the second box is filled with 11 duck of color-11 and 33 ducks of color-00.   \nEach duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors.
