b'\n          \n            Jack and you are friends . One fine day Jack challenged you to solve a problem .\nJack gives a string s, and you can do two types of operations on it:\n\n\xe2\x97\x8f\tDelete the last character of the string.\n\xe2\x97\x8f\tDuplicate the string: s:=s+s, where + denotes concatenation.\n\nYou can use each operation any number of times (possibly none).\n\nYour task is to find the lexicographically smallest string of length exactly k that can be obtained by doing these operations on string s.\n\nA string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds:\n\n\xe2\x97\x8f\ta is a prefix of b, but a\xe2\x89\xa0b\n\xe2\x97\x8f\tIn the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.\n\n            \n                \n                    Input Format\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, k  \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the original string s and the length of the desired string.\nThe second line contains the string s, consisting of n lowercase English letters.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint the lexicographically smallest string of length k that can be obtained by doing the operations on string s.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n,k\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8 16\ndbcadabc\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\ndbcadabcdbcadabc\n\n\nExplanation\nIt is optimal to make one duplication: "dbcadabc" ? "dbcadabcdbcadabc".\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4 5\nabcd\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\naaaaa\n\n\nExplanation\nIt is optimal to delete the last 3 characters, then duplicate the string 3 times, then delete the last 3 characters to make the string have length k.\n"abcd" ? "abc" ? "ab" ? "a" ? "aa" ? "aaaa" ? "aaaaaaaa" ? "aaaaaaa" ? "aaaaaa" ? "aaaaa".\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85mahendra444\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DELAPP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 mahendra444, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-10-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
