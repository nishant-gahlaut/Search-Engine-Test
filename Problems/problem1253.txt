b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef Go has planted a flower field \xe2\x80\x94 a grid with nn rows and m columns. In each cell of this grid, a single flower is planted; let's denote the type of the flower planted in cell (i,j) by ai,j.\nToday, Chef Go is going to make a new menu with two dishes: Tom Yum Goong and Tom Kha Kai. He needs to pick as many flowers as possible to decorate the dishes and make them look attractive. Each dish can only be decorated with flowers of a single type, so he can only pick flowers of one type or two different types. Also, Chef Go wants the flowers he picks to form one connected area, so that he can finish his job quickly. A connected area is a set of cells such that we can move from any cell to any other cell in this set by only moving between side-adjacent cells from the set.\nHelp Chef Go find the size of the largest connected area in his flower field which contains at most two types of flowers.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m denoting the size of the field.\nn lines follow. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n), the i-th of these lines contains m space-separated integers ai,1,ai,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ai,m.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of flowers that can be picked.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa42,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa44\xe2\x8b\x85106 for each valid i and j\nthe size of the input will be less than 13 MB\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa4100 for each valid i and j\n\nSubtask #2 (20 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid i and j\n\nSubtask #3 (60 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4 5\n1 1 2 3 1\n3 1 2 5 2\n5 2 1 5 6\n1 3 1 2 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nExplanation\nOne connected area with maximum size consists of the following flowers (flowers marked by dots are not picked):\n1 1 2 . .\n. 1 2 . .\n. 2 1 . .\n. . 1 2 1\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\niloveksh\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Disjoint Set Union, Graph Algos, BFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Algorithms, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2336\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-04-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n4 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
