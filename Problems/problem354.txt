b'\nAn array is said to be good if all its elements are distinct, i.e. no two elements of the array are equal to each other.\nYou are given a positive integer NN and an integer KK such that N\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4(N+12)N\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4(N+12).\nConstruct an array AA of length NN that satisfies the following conditions\n\nAA has exactly KK good (contiguous) subarrays, and\nEvery element of AA is an integer from 11 to NN (both inclusive).\n\nIf there are multiple such arrays, you can print any of them.\nNote: It can be shown that for all inputs satisfying the given constraints, there is always a valid solution.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains an integer TT, the number of testcases. The description of the TT testcases follow.\nEach testcase consists of a single line with two space separated integers, NN and KK respectively.\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each testcase print NN space separated integers, the elements of the constructed array.\nIf there are multiple outputs, you can print any of them.\nYour output will be considered correct only if the following conditions are satisfied,\nEvery element of the array is between 11 and NN, and\nThe array has exactly KK good subarrays\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nN\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4(N+12)N\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4(N+12)\nSum of NN over all testcases is atmost 3\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n5 5\n5 15\n5 7\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 2 1 1\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: N=5,K=5N=5,K=5. All subarrays of length 11 are good, therefore every array of size NN has at least NN good subarrays. If all elements are equal then these will be the only good subarrays so the given array {1,1,1,1,1}{1,1,1,1,1} is a valid solution. Observe that under the constraints there are 55 different solutions (one for each value 11 through 55) and all of them will be considered correct.\nTest Case 2: N=5,K=15N=5,K=15. There are only (N+12)=15(N+12)=15 subarrays, including the array itself. Therefore the array itself must be good which leads us to the solution given above. Any permutation of {1,2,3,4,5}{1,2,3,4,5} is also a valid solution, thus there are 5!=1205!=120 different solutions to this case and all of them will be considered correct.\nTest Case 3: N=5,K=7N=5,K=7. The constructed array is A={1,2,2,1,1}A={1,2,2,1,1}. You may verify that the only good subarrays of AA, in addition to the 55 subarrays of length 11, are those shown below (subarrays are highlighted red).\n\n{1,2,2,1,1}{1,2,2,1,1}\n{1,2,2,1,1}{1,2,2,1,1}\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsrikkanth_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DISTK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, srikkanth_adm, start25\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2015\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-02-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
