Chef also has two other integers, A and B. He needs to run Q queries on the tree, each of which can be one of the following two types:\n1 u v w \xe2\x80\x94 add w to the labels of all vertices which lie on a simple path between nodes u and v.\n2 u v \xe2\x80\x94 find the number of vertices x on a simple path between u and v for which A*Cx + B \xe2\x89\xa5 0.\n\n\nPlease help Chef run these queries.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. \nThe first line of each test case contains two positive numbers: N and Q.\nThe second line of each test case contains two positive numbers A and B.\nThe third line of each test case contains N integers \xe2\x80\x94 C1, C2, ... , CN \xe2\x80\x94 labels of the nodes.\nThe next N - 1 lines contain two integers u, v each, denoting a pair vertices connected by an edge. \nThe following Q lines contains queries.\nOutput\nFor each query of the second type, output a single line containing a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 its result.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, Q \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 u, v \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 A, |B|, |Ci| \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 w \xe2\x89\xa4 104\nSum of N over all test cases cannot be greater than 105.\nSum of Q over all test cases cannot be greater than 105.\nAll numbers in the input are integers.\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n5 6\n1 0\n-1 2 -3 4 -5\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n1 4 3 1\n2 4 3\n1 3 3 1\n2 3 3\n1 3 3 2\n2 4 3\n\nOutput:\n3\n0\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFTREE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Segment Trees, HLD\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3055\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-12-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n4 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
