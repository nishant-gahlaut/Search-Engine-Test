b'\nDexter wants to make a hexagon by using six sticks for sides from a collection of sticks of lengths 1, 2, 3, ... N. Dexter will only make valid hexagons whose area is strictly positive.\n\nHe considers a hexagon "good" if the biggest stick has  length at least L and lengths of all the other sticks are not more than X.  A "good" hexagon does not have sticks of the same length more than K times. \n\nHow many ways he can make a "good" hexagon?\n\nFor example, when N=8, L=7, X=5, K=3: { 1,2,2,5,5,7 } is a good hexagon but {1,2,2,2,2,7}, { 1,2,3,4,5,6},{1,2,3,4,6,7} are not .\n\nTwo hexagons are considered different if their side length sets are different. For example {1,2,3,4,5,6} , {1,1,1,2,2,3} and {1,1,2,2,2,3} are all different \n\nhexagons. But {1,2,3,4,5,6} and { 2,4,6,1,3,5} are not different.\nInput\n Input contains four integers N( 2 <= N <= 10^9) , L ( 2 <= L <= N and N-L<=100) ,  X(  1<=X< L ) and K ( 1 <=  K <= 5) .\nOutput\n Output the number of different ways to make a "good" hexagon % 1000000007.\nSample Input\n10 8 6 2\nSample Output\n374\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nimran_adm\n\n\nTester:\n1\xe2\x98\x85gamabunta\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CNTHEX\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Digit DP, Backtracking\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Algorithms, Complete Search\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2532\n\n\nDate Added:\n6-08-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.05955 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
