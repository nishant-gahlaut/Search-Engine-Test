b'\nRead problems statements in Russian and Bengali.\nChef has an array $A$ with $N$ elements. He wants to find $N$ points $P_1, \\dots, P_N$ with integer coordinates on the 2D coordinate plane such that, for all pairs of indices $i$ and $j$ ($1 \\leq i \\lt j \\leq N$), the Manhattan distance from $P_i$ to $P_j$ is $A_i+A_j$. Help him find any $N$ points satisfying the condition, or state that no such points exist.\nAs a reminder, the Manhattan distance between the points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is defined as $|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains an integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The $T$ test cases then follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.\nThe second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, if there is no set of points satisfying the stated condition, output NO.\nOtherwise, output YES on one line, then output $N$ lines. Each line should contain two integers $X_i$ and $Y_i$ ($-10^{18} \\leq X_i, Y_i \\leq 10^{18}$) denoting the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the point $P_i$ respectively.\nIt can be proven that if a solution exists, then a solution exists under the constraints above.\nOutput is case insensitive.\nConstraints\n\n$1 \\leq T \\leq 10^4$\n$1 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$\n$1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9$\nSum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2\n5 13\n3\n8 4 20\n5\n2 9 12 3 8\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\n3 9\n13 17\nYES\n18 5\n10 1\n1 16\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\n\nFor the first test case, we can choose $P_1 = (3,9)$ and $P_2 = (13,17)$. The Manhattan distance between $P_1$ and $P_2$ is $|3-13|+|9-17|=18$, and $A_1 + A_2 = 5 + 13 = 18$.\nFor the second test case, we can choose $P_1 = (18,5)$, $P_2 = (10,1)$, and $P_3 = (1,16)$.\n\nThe Manhattan distance between $P_1$ and $P_2$ is $|18-10|+|5-1|=12$, and $A_1 + A_2 = 8 + 4 = 12$.\nThe Manhattan distance between $P_1$ and $P_3$ is $|18-1|+|5-16|=28$, and $A_1 + A_3 = 8 + 20 = 28$.\nThe Manhattan distance between $P_2$ and $P_3$ is $|10-1|+|1-16|=24$, and $A_2 + A_3 = 4 + 20 = 24$.\nFor the third test case, it can be proven that there does not exist $5$ points satisfying these constraints.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85flamestorm153\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PAIRDIST\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Constructive\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2012\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-09-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
