b"\nNathan is preparing for the Dash marathon. He has NN training plans. The i-th plan has an effectiveness of Ai, but requires that at least Bi other training plans must be performed before it. A training plan cannot be repeated. \nIf he performs some K>0 distinct trainings - P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PK (1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4N,Pi\xe2\x89\xa0Pj) then his training score is \xe2\x88\x91Kj=1APjK. If Nathan does not perform any training plan (K=0), then his score is 0.\nWhat is the highest score that Nathan can get by performing zero or more training plans, if he can perform them in any order?\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains N - the number of training plans.\nThe second line contains N integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN where Ai is the effectiveness of the i-th training plan.\nThe third line contains N integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN where Bi is the number of pre-requisite training plans for the i-th training plan.\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each test case, output a single real number - the highest score that Nathan can get by performing zero or more training plans.\nYour answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10\xe2\x88\x926.\nFormally, let your answer be X, and the jury's answer be Y. Your answer is accepted if and only if |X\xe2\x88\x92Y|max(1,|Y|)\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x88\x926.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\xe2\x88\x92105\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x921\nSum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n4\n-9 -21 -4 -43\n0 0 0 0\n5\n10 14 5 9 1\n4 1 3 0 0\n7\n-1 101 5 63 -7 -88 59\n0 1 6 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0.000000\n11.500000\n54.333333\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: It is optimal for Nathan to not perform any training plans as all the plans have negative Ai value.\nTest case 2: It is optimal for Nathan to:\n\nFirst, perform the 4-th training plan (for which Bi=0).\nThen perform the 2-nd training plan (for which Bi=1 which is satisfied as he has already performed 1 training plan)\n\nTest case 3: It is optimal for Nathan to:\n\nFirst, perform the 1-st training plan (for which Bi=0).\nThen perform the 2-nd training plan (for which Bi=1 which is satisfied as he has already performed 1 training plan)\nThen perform the 4-th training plan (for which Bi=2 which is satisfied as he has already performed 2 training plans)\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85ereh\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TRAINPLN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, ereh, greedy, priority-queue, start32\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2065\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-03-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
