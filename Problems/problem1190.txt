b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. It is also guaranteed that for each valid i, Ai+A1\xe2\x89\xa5Ai+1.\nAlice and Bob want to play Q independent games using this sequence. Before they play these games, Alice should choose a positive integer G between 1 and M (inclusive). The rules of each game are as follows:\n\nThere is a set S of positive integers representing allowed moves in this game. For each valid i, in the i-th game, this set is S={ALi,ALi+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ARi} (in other words, given by a contiguous subsequence of A).\nThe game is played with a single pile. Let's denote the number of objects in this pile by P. At the beginning of the game, P=G. In other words, Alice and Bob play all the games with the same initial number of objects that Alice chooses.\nThe players alternate turns; Alice plays first.\nIn each turn, the current player must choose a positive integer b from the set S such that b\xe2\x89\xa4P and remove b objects from the pile, i.e. change P to P\xe2\x88\x92b.\nWhen the current player cannot choose any such integer b, this player loses this game.\n\nBoth players play optimally. You need to find the maximum number of games Alice can win if she chooses G optimally.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, Q and M.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nQ lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Li and Ri.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum number of games Alice can win.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q,M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4108 for each valid i\nAi+A1\xe2\x89\xa5Ai+1>Ai for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Li\xe2\x89\xa4Ri\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of M over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (5 points): \n\nN,Q,M\xe2\x89\xa4400\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 400\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 400\nthe sum of M over all test cases does not exceed 400\n\nSubtask #2 (30 points): \n\nN,Q,M\xe2\x89\xa45,000\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5,000\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 5,000\nthe sum of M over all test cases does not exceed 5,000\n\nSubtask #3 (65 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3 2 10\n2 3 4\n1 2\n2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The set of allowed moves in the first game is S={2,3} and in the second game, it is S={3,4}.
