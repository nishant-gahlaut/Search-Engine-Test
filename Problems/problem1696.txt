b"\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nThis is an interactive problem.\nSushi has a sequence of integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN; each of them is between 11 and 106 inclusive. You do not know this sequence, but for a strange reason (maybe because you love her!), you have to find it.\nYou may ask up to 2,222 queries. In each query:\n\nYou should choose two integers K and X (1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N+1, 1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4106).\nSushi creates a new sequence B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN+1, where BK=X and if we deleted the element BK from this sequence, we would obtain the sequence A.\nThen, Sushi tells you the number of inversions in the sequence B, i.e. the number of pairs (i,j) such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4N+1 and Bi>Bj.\n\nInteraction\n\nFirst, you should read a line containing a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for T test cases follows.\nFor each test case, you should start by reading a line containing a single integer N.\nTo ask a query, you should print a line containing the character '?', followed by a space and two space-separated integers K and X describing your query. Then, you must read a line containing a single integer \xe2\x80\x95 the answer to the query.\nWhen you have guessed the sequence, print a single line containing the character '!', followed by a space and N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN (1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid i). This does not count as a query.\n\nIf you ask more than 2,222 queries or do not follow the interaction format, you may receive any verdict.\nDo not forget to flush the output after printing each line!\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa420\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\nExample Input\nYou             Sushi\n                2\n                2\n? 1 1\n                1\n? 2 4\n                2\n? 2 2\n                3\n? 3 4\n                1\n! 3 1\n                1\n? 1 5\n                1\n? 1 4\n                0\n! 4\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The sequence Sushi has is A=[3,1]. Your interaction with Sushi is as follows:\n\n? 1 1: Sushi creates the sequence B=[1,3,1] and returns the number of inversions in it, which is 1.\n? 2 4: Sushi creates the sequence B=[3,4,1] and returns the number of inversions in it, which is 2.\n? 2 2: Sushi creates the sequence B=[3,2,1] and returns the number of inversions in it, which is 3.\n? 3 4: Sushi creates the sequence B=[3,1,4] and returns the number of inversions in it, which is 1.\n! 3 1: You have guessed the sequence to be [3,1], which is correct.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85sjshohag\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/INVERACT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Interactive Problems, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Special, Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3074\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-10-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
