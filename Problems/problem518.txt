b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given two binary strings $S$ and $P$, each with length $N$. A binary string contains only characters \'0\' and \'1\'. For each valid $i$, let\'s denote the $i$-th character of $S$ by $S_i$.\nYou have to convert the string $S$ into $P$ using zero or more operations. In one operation, you should choose two indices $i$ and $j$ ($1 \\leq i \\lt j \\leq N$) such that $S_i$ is \'1\' and $S_j$ is \'0\', and swap $S_i$ with $S_j$.\nDetermine if it is possible to convert $S$ into $P$ by performing some operations.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.\nThe second line contains a single string $S$.\nThe third line contains a single string $P$.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "Yes" if it is possible to convert $S$ into $P$ or "No" otherwise (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n$1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5$\n$1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n$S$ and $P$ contain only characters \'0\' and \'1\'\nthe sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points):\n\n$N \\leq 14$\nthe sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $100$\n\nSubtask #2 (30 points): the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $1,000$\nSubtask #3 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2\n00\n00\n3\n101\n010\n4\n0110\n0011\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYes\nNo\nYes\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The strings are already equal.\nExample case 2: It can be showed that it is impossible to convert $S$ into $P$.\nExample case 3: You can swap $S_2$ with $S_4$. The strings will then be equal.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85the_hyp0cr1t3\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SWAP10HG\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, Greedy\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
