b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are N police officers numbered 1 through N and M thieves numbered 1 through M. All people (police officers and thieves) are points in a Cartesian plane. Let's denote the coordinates of the i-th officer by (Xpi,Ypi), and the coordinates of the i-th thief by (Xti,Yti).\nA thief is arrested if there is a subset of police officers which form a convex polygon such that the thief is located strictly inside that polygon.\nThe police station wants to send reinforcements \xe2\x80\x95 zero or more police officers \xe2\x80\x95 to make sure all the thieves are arrested. The coordinates of these additional officers may be chosen arbitrarily (they may be any real numbers); it is not allowed to move the officers which were present initially. Calculate the minimum number of police officers that need to be sent as reinforcements in order to arrest all the thieves.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nN lines follow. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Xpi and Ypi.\nM more lines follow. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4M), the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Xti and Yti.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of additional police officers.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n0\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n|Xpi|,|Ypi|\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x97108 for each valid i\n|Xti|,|Yti|\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x97108 for each valid i\nno two people (police officers or thieves) have the same position\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (40 points): N,M\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nSubtask #2 (60 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n1 1\n10 10\n20 20\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85erfaniaa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/POLICE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 convex-hull, corner-case, erfaniaa, geometry, ltime74, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-07-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
