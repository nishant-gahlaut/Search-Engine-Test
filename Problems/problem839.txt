b'\nA binary string SS of length N is called K-balanced string if it holds the following property: For each index i(1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N) such that Si= \'1\', there must exist an index j(1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4N) such that Sj= \'1\'  and \xe2\x88\xa3i\xe2\x88\x92j\xe2\x88\xa3=K, where \xe2\x88\xa3x\xe2\x88\xa3 denotes the absolute value of x.\nFor example, if K=1, "00", "110", "011011" are 1-balanced strings, while "010" , "1001" are not; if K=2, "10101", "0101000101" are 2-balanced strings, while "0110" , "1001", "010" are not. \nChef is given a binary string S of length N and an integer K. He can perform the following operation on the string:\n\nSelect an index of the string, and flip the character at that index. This means if the character was "0", it becomes "1", and vice versa.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of operations Chef will have to perform so that the string becomes K-balanced?\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,K.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string S.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the minimum number operation Chef needs to perform on the given string to make it K-balanced.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\nS contains only characters \'0\' and \'1\'.\nThe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n2 1\n01\n3 1\n111\n4 2\n1101\n5 3\n11110\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: Chef applies one operation on the index 2 and the string becomes "00" which is a 1-balanced string.\nTest case 2: The given string is already 1-balanced.\nTest case 3: Chef applies one operation on the index 3 and the string becomes "1111" which is a 2-balanced string.\nTest case 4: Chef applies one operation on the index 2 and another operation on the index 3. Hence, the string becomes "10010" which is a 3-balanced string.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85soumyadeep_21\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/KBALANCE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2140\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-09-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
