b'\nRead problem statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are the owner of a bakery and you have mm employees who serve the customers.\nWhen a customer enters the bakery, he waits in line behind other customers who are waiting (or he is the first of the line if there are no other customers waiting).\nWhenever there is an employee who is not serving anybody and there is at least one customer waiting in line, one employee immediately starts serving the first person in the line (who, therefore, leaves the line). Serving a customer requires exactly d seconds.\nThe waiting time of a customer is the number of seconds elapsed between his entrance in the bakery and the moment someone starts serving him.\nYou have just opened the bakery today, and you know that, for each i=0,1,\xe2\x80\xa6,n\xe2\x88\x921, with probability p a customer will enter the bakery exactly i seconds after the opening (these n events are independent and the probability p is the same for all of them).\nWhat is the expected value of the total waiting time of all the customers (that is, the sum of the waiting times of all the customers)?\nInput Format\n\nThe only line of the input contains the three integers n, m, d and the real number p \xe2\x80\x93 the number of seconds at which a customer may enter, the number of employees, the amount of seconds necessary to serve a customer, the probability that a customer enters at any given second.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint a single real number, the expected value of the total waiting time of all the customers. Your answer is considered correct if its relative or absolute error does not exceed 10\xe2\x88\x926.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450000 \n1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x89\xa41000\n0.4\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x89\xa40.6\nThe number p is given with exactly 4 digits after the decimal point.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2 1 5 0.4000\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0.6400000000\n\n\nExplanation\nThere is only one employee, it requires 5 seconds to serve a customer and the probability that a customer enters at a given second is 0.4.\nThe total waiting time is 0 unless a customer enters at second 0 (and is immediately served) and another customer enters after one second and has to wait for 5\xe2\x88\x921=4 seconds before being served. The probability of this series of events is 0.42; hence the expected total waiting times is 0.42\xe2\x8b\x854=0.64.\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3 2 1000 0.5000\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n124.7500000000\n\n\nExplanation\nIf there are in total at most 2 customers, then noone waits since there are two employees. Hence, the total waiting time is 0 unless there are 3 customers, which happens with probability 0.53. In such case, the last customer waits for 1000\xe2\x88\x922=998 seconds. Hence the answer is 0.53\xe2\x8b\x85998=124.75.\n\n                        Sample Input 3\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5 3 9 0.5891\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 3\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2.1875381171\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 4\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n40 10 30 0.4567\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 4\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n86.7734103628\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85dario2994\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BAKERY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dario2994, medium, snckfl21, snckfp21\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-01-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n8 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
