b'\nISRO has shot to global fame after Mangalyaan. They have decided to build hi-tech ground stations throughout the country which can be used either as a control station or as a launch station (but not as both simultaneously). A control station is one which has all controls to the rocket. A launch station is the site from where a rocket is launched. For a successful launch, ISRO has identified that they need 2 control stations and that these 2 control stations should be equidistant from the launch station.\nInitially there is only one ground station having index 0, where the headquarters of ISRO is located. Over a period of time, they plan to build more and more ground stations.\nThey can perform two kinds of operations (for given V): \n\n\n\nType 0: Build a new ground station and construct a one-way road from the ground station having index V to the newly built ground station. In other words, if the index of the newly built ground station is W, then a one way road V->W having length = 1 is constructed. The index of the new ground station will be the smallest positive integer which is not the index of any existing ground station. (Of course, this also helps them to keep track of the number of ground stations they have built so far.)\n\n\n\nType 1: Given a ground station with index V, count how many unordered pairs (P, Q) of ground stations exist such that the ground stations P and Q are both reachable from V (paths from V to P and V to Q exist),  and there exists a ground station R (need not be reachable from V), such that distance(P, R) = distance(Q, R), R \xe2\x89\xa0 P, R \xe2\x89\xa0 Q and P \xe2\x89\xa0 Q. Of course, ISRO wants to know this information beforehand since such pairs (P, Q) are possible candidates for control stations, and R is a possible candidate for the launch station.\n\n\n\n\nAdding more explanation\n"Given a ground station with index V, count how many unordered pairs (P, Q) of ground stations exist such that the ground stations P and Q are both reachable from V (paths from V to P and V to Q exist), and there exists a ground station R (need not be reachable from V), such that distance(P,R) = distance(Q, R), R \xe2\x89\xa0 P, R \xe2\x89\xa0 Q and P \xe2\x89\xa0 Q."\n\nAs this says, there need not be path from R->P or P->R. How ever please use the following as definition of distance.\n\nDistance(X, Y) = Number of roads in the unique path from X to Y, if the given road network were bi-directional.\n\nPlease note that, V->P and V->Q should still exist in directed road network.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer M denoting the number of operations.\nEach of the next M lines contain 2 integers -  type and V.\nif type = 0, then perform type 0 operation (for given V).\nif type = 1, then perform type 1 operation (for given V).\nOutput\nFor each test case, for each query of type 1, you must print the answer to the query on a separate line. \nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 type \xe2\x89\xa4 1\nFor both type of operations 0 & 1, the given ground station V would have already been built.\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n4\n1 0\n0 0\n0 1\n1 0\n6\n0 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n0 2\n1 1\n\nOutput:\n0\n1\n1\n2\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\nFirst operation is of type 1. There is only 1 ground station (with index 0), so number of pairs are 0.\nSecond operation is of type 0. A new ground station with index 1 is built, and a road from 0->1 (having length 1) is added.\nThird operation is of type 0 again. A new ground station with index 2 is built, and a road from 1->2 (having length 1) is added.\nFourth operation is of type 1. There are 3 ground stations now. (0, 2) is the only valid pair as there exists ground station 1 with distance(2, 1) = distance(0, 1) = 1, and both the stations 0 & 2 are reachable from 0. \nExample case 2:\nThere are 2 operations of type 1. For the first one, (0, 2) is the only valid pair, and for the second one, there are 2 valid pairs pairs - (2, 3) and (1, 4).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 acm-icpc, acmamr14, admin, dfs-order, medium, segment-tree\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-10-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nJAVA, C, CPP14, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
