b"\nChef's college is starting next week. There are SS subjects in total, and he needs to choose KK of them to attend each day, to fulfill the required number of credits to pass the semester. There are N+1N+1 buildings. His hostel is in building number 00. Subject ii is taught in building AiAi. After each subject, there is a break, during which he goes back to his hostel. There are MM bidirectional paths of length 11 which connects building uu to building vv. Find the minimum possible total distance Chef needs to travel each day if he chooses his subjects wisely.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contain M+2M+2 lines of input.\nFirst line will contain 44 space separated integers NN, MM, SS, KK, number of buildings other than hostel building, number of edges, total number of subjects taught, number of subjects required to pass the semester.\nNext MM lines have 22 space separated integers uu, vv representing the path connecting buildings uu and vv.\nNext line has SS space separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6ASA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6AS representing the building in which ithith subject is taught.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line answer to the problem.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa431\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa43\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,S\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N,S\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x971051\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x97105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4S1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4S\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N\n0\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N0\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nIts guaranteed that the graph is connected and has no self loops.\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 3 2 2\n0 1\n1 2\n2 0\n1 2\n2 2 2 2\n0 1\n1 2\n1 2\n6 7 5 3\n0 1\n0 2\n0 4\n1 3\n1 4\n2 5\n2 6\n1 2 3 5 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n6\n8\n\n\nExplanation\nTestCase 1: First Chef attends the subject in the building 22 and he travels 11 units to go there and 11 units to come back during the break to the hostel.\nSecond subject he attends in the building 11 and he travels 11 unit to go there and 11 unit to come back during the break to the hostel.\nIn total the total minimum distance to be travelled is 2+2=42+2=4 units. \nTestCase 2: First Chef attends the subject in the building 22 and he travels 22 units to go there and 22 units to come back during the break to the hostel.\nSecond subject he attends in the building 11 and he travels 11 unit to go there and 11 unit to come back during the break to the hostel.\nIn total the total minimum distance to be travelled is 4+2=64+2=6 units. \nTestCase 3: First Chef attends the subject in the building 33 and he travels 22 units to go there and 22 units to come back during the break to the hostel.\nSecond subject he attends in the building 11 and he travels 11 unit to go there and 11 unit to come back during the break to the hostel.\nFinal subject he attends in the building 22 and he travels 11 unit to go there and 11 unit to come back during the break to the hostel.\nIn total the total minimum distance to be travelled is 4+2+2=84+2+2=8 units.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CLASSES\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Graphs, Dijkstra's Algorithm, BFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Shortest Paths, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2379\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
