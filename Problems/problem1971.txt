Consider a vector a of length N2 accessible via 0-based indexing.\nLet's call the following transformation a TVT-transformation (Terrible Vector transformation).\n\n\nWe will call a vector g a good vector if \n\n\nFor some reason, you want to find a vector a of length N2 such that it's elements are either 1 or -1 and after applying TVT-transformation (i.e. b), it results in a good vector.\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case is described by one line containing one integer N.\nOutput\nFor each test case output one line with the word NO if it's not possible to find such vector. Otherwise output YES on the first line and N2 space-separated integers (each either -1 or 1) on the second - the answer for this test case.\nIf there are multiple possible answers, output any one of them.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\n1\nYES\n1 1 1 -1\n\n\nExplanation\nSample example 2: After TVT-transformation, the vector will transform to (4, 0, 0, 4) which is a good vector for N = 2\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85pavel1996\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85kevinsogo\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TERVEC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 hadamard-matrix, hard, matrices, paley-construction, pavel1996, sept15, sylvesters-criterion, williamson\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2644\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-07-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
