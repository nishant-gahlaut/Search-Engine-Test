b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nYou are given a positive integer KK and a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. Initially, each element of this sequence is 0 or 1; your goal is to make all elements equal to 0.\nIn order to do that, you may perform the following operation any number of times:\n\nChoose a subarray (a contiguous subsequence) with length K, i.e. choose two indices L and R such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N and R\xe2\x88\x92L+1=K.\nChoose one element of that subarray and change it to 0, i.e. choose an index P such that L\xe2\x89\xa4P\xe2\x89\xa4R and change AP to 0.\nThe cost of this operation is the sum of this subarray AL+AL+1+\xe2\x80\xa6+AR before AP is changed.\n\nFind the minimum total cost (sum of costs of individual operations) of making all elements of A equal to 0.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum cost of turning all elements of A into zeros. \nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4200\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 4\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n5 3\n1 0 1 0 1\n4 4\n1 1 0 1\n3 1\n1 1 0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n6\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The minimum cost is 3 and it can be obtained using the following sequence of operations:\n\nchoose the subarray [L,R]=[2,4] and set A3=0 with cost 1\nchoose the subarray [1,3] and set A1=0 with cost 1\nchoose the subarray [3,5] and set A5=0 with cost 1\n\nExample case 2: We have to choose the whole sequence ([L,R]=[1,4]) in each operation, so the total cost is 3+2+1=6:\n\nchoose the subarray [1,4] and set A1=0 with cost 3 \nchoose the subarray [1,4] and set A2=0 with cost 2\nchoose the subarray [1,4] and set A4=0 with cost 1\n\nExample case 3: The minimum cost is 2 and it can be obtained using the following sequence of operations:\n\nchoose the subarray [2,2] and set A2=0 with cost 1\nchoose the subarray [1,1] and set A1=0 with cost 1\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85losmi247\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CONDEL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Subarray\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Groupings\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2008\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-02-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
