b'\nYou are given a string S of length N, which consists of digits from 0 to 9. You can apply the following operation to the string:\n\nChoose an integer L with 1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4N and apply S_i = (S_i + 1) \\mod 10 for each 1 \\le i \\le L.\n\nFor example, if S=39590, then choosing L=3 and applying the operation yields the string S=\\underline{406}90.\nThe prefix of string S of length l\\;(1 \\leq l \\leq \\mid S \\mid ) is string S_1 S_2 \\dots S_l. A prefix of length l is called good if S_1=0, S_2=0, \\dots, S_l=0. Find the length of the longest good prefix that can be obtained in string S by applying the given operation maximum K times.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow:\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N, K.\nThe second line of each test case contains the string S.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line the length of the longest good prefix that can be obtained in string S by applying the given operation maximum K times.\nConstraints\n\n1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5\n1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5\n0 \\leq K \\leq 10^9\n\\mid S \\mid = N\nS contains digits from 0 to 9\nSum of N over all test cases does not exceed 3 \\cdot 10^5.\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (100 points): Original constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n6\n3 5\n380\n3 9\n380\n4 2\n0123\n5 13\n78712\n6 10\n051827\n8 25\n37159725\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n3\n1\n3\n2\n5\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: There is no way to obtain zeros on the prefix of the string S = 380 by applying the given operation maximum 5 times.\nTest case 2: The optimal strategy is: choose L = 2 and apply the operation twice, resulting in S=500, then choose L = 1 and apply the operation 5 times, resulting in S=000.\nTest case 4: One of the possible sequence of operations is the following:\n\nChoose L = 5 and apply the operation thrice, resulting in S=01045.\nChoose L = 2 and apply the operation 9 times, resulting in S=90045. \nChoose L = 1 and apply the operation once, resulting in S=00045. \n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85soumyadeep_21\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85tabr\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PREZ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 binary-search, easy, ltime104, modular-arithmetic, soumyadeep_21\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1790\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-01-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
