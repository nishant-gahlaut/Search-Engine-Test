b'\n\xc2\xa0\nProblem description.\nSuper Hacker Barrel Titor has successfully infiltrated the evil organization SERN. He wants a top secret document by the name " Gadget i, Ver. j ",but it is protected by a password. He has the following clues:\nThe password c is a positive integer\nc is the smallest integer that can be obtained from the equation:\nax + by = c , by substituting arbitrary integer values for x and y\na and b are the ith and jth fibonacci numbers respectively\n\nIn other words, find the smallest value of c that can be obtained from the equation fib[i] * x + fib[j] * y = c\nHelp Titor obtain the document by decoding the clues and finding the password!\n \n  NOTE: The Fibonacci series is as follows : 0th Term : 0 , 1st Term : 1, 2nd Term : 1, 3rd Term : 2, 4th Term : 3 and so on..  \nInput\nThe first line of the input has T, the number of test cases.\nEach of the next T lines contains two integers i and j, denoting the ith and jth fibonacci numbers respectively.(0-based indexing)\nOutput\nPrint one line containing the integer c, for each test case.\nNote: It is guaranteed that the output can be stored in a 64-bit integer variable \nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 i,j \xe2\x89\xa4 100000 \n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n2\n3 6\n0 1\nOutput:\n2\n1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case 1.The 3rd and 6th fibonacci numbers are 2 and 8. The smallest positive integer c that can be formed using 2x+8y=c is 2 (substituting x=-3 and y=1)\nExample case 2.The 0th and 1st fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1. The smallest positive integer c that can be formed using 0x+1y=c is 1 (substituting y=1)\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85akshayvenkat97\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/HACKS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 akshayvenkat97, easy, fibonacci-numbers, greatest-common-divisor, popc2018\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-01-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
