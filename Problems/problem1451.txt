b'\nRead problems statements in mandarin chinese, russian and vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a rooted tree T with N vertices. The vertices are numbered from 1 to N, and vertex 1 is the root. You are also given M lists A1, A2, .., AM, where each Ai contains a subset of the vertices in T.\nConsider a new bipartite graph G = (L, R, E), where L = {l1, l2, .., lM} and R = {r1, r2, .., rN} denote the two bi-partitions of the vertex set and E = { (li, rj), such that there exists a k which is an ancestor of j in T, and is also contained in Ai}. That is, there is an edge from li to rj if and only if Ai contains a vertex of T which is an ancestor of j in T.\nNote: Vertex u is an ancestor of vertex v, if it is on the path from the root to v, both end points included.\nYou need to compute the size of the maximum matching in G.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer, Q, which denotes the number of testcases. The description of each testcase follows.\nThe first line of each testcase contains two integers: N and M, which denote the number of vertices in the tree and the number of lists respectively.\nThe next line contains N - 1 integers: P2, P3, ..., PN, where Pi denotes the parent of vertex i in T.\nThe i-th of the next M lines describes the i-th list Ai. The first integer in the line is |Ai|, which is the size of the i-th list. This is followed by |Ai| integers in the same line, which denote the elements of Ai.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the size of the maximum matching of the corresponding bipartite graph.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 4\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 5000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 5000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Pi \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 every element of a list \xe2\x89\xa4 N\nAll the elements of a single list are distinct\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Sum of sizes of all lists in one test case \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n12 8\n4 1 1 2 7 8 4 2 12 12 4\n1 7\n1 7\n2 6 11\n2 8 11\n2 10 8\n2 12 8\n2 8 10\n2 7 12\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nExplanation\nThe left bipartition of G contains 8 vertices: l1, l2, ..., l8 and the right bipartition contains 12: r1, r2, ..., r12. Some of the edges of this bipartite graph are:\n(l1, r7), (l1, r6), (l2, r7), (l2, r6), (l3, r6), (l3, r11), (l4, r8), (l4, r7), (l4, r6), (l4, r11). There are more edges.\nThere is a matching of size 6 in this graph which consists of the edges { (l1, r6), (l2, r7), (l3, r11), (l4, r8), (l5, r10), (l6, r12)}. There is no larger matching and hence the answer is 6.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin3\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BIPARTRE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Maximum Flow, Maximum Bipartite Matching\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos, Flow Networks\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-07-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
