b'\n Read problems statements in Russian here\nThe Head Chef has been playing with Fibonacci numbers for long . He has learnt several tricks related to Fibonacci numbers . Now he wants to test his chefs in the skills .  \nA fibonacci number is defined by the recurrence : \nf(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n > 2 and f(1) = 0 and f(2) = 1 .  \nGiven a number  A   , determine if it is a fibonacci number.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer  A  denoting the number to be checked .\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing "YES" if the given number is a fibonacci number , otherwise output a single line containing "NO" . \nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 number of digits in A  \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n  The sum of number of digits in A in all test cases   <= 10000.  \n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n4\n5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. The first few fibonacci numbers are 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 ,5 , 8 , 13 and so on and the series is increasing . Only 3 and 5 appear in this series while 4 does not appear in the series . \n\n\n\nAuthor:\nvineet_adm\n\n\nTester:\n5\xe2\x98\x85rubanenko\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/AMIFIB\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Fibonacci Series, Big Integer, Offline Queries\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Sequences and Progression, Arbitrary Precision, Algorithms, Queries\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1663\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-10-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
