b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nIn Chefland, each citizen has their own personal string. Chef is no exception. Recently, his string broke and he went to a shop to get a new one.\nThere are two strings in the shop: AA and BB. Chef may choose any substring As of A (possibly empty) and any substring Bs of B (also possibly empty). Then, the shop assistant cuts these substrings out and sells a single string C=As+Bs (here, + denotes string concatenation) to Chef. For example, if A is "aba" and B is "cde", then some of the strings Chef can buy are "ba", "bac", "bacd", "ae", "d", "acde", "aba", "cde" or "abacde".\nChef has seen a lot of strings in his life and he liked exactly N of them (numbered 1 through N). For each valid i, the i-th of these strings is denoted by Si and according to Chef, it has a beauty bi. Let\'s denote the number of substrings of C that are equal to Si by cnti(C). If Chef buys a string C, he says that the pleasure he gets from this string is \xe2\x88\x91Ni=1cnti(C)\xe2\x8b\x85bi.\nWhat is the maximum possible pleasure Chef can get from a string he buys in the shop?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single string A.\nThe second line contains a single string B.\nThe third line contains a single integer N.\nThe following N lines describe Chef\'s favourite strings. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains a string Si, followed by a space and an integer bi.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum pleasure.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4|A|,|B|\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4|Si|\xe2\x89\xa426 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4105 for each valid i\nA,B,S1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SN contain only lowercase English letters\nS1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SN are pairwise distinct\nthe sum of |A| over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85103\nthe sum of |B| over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85103\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85104\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points, time limit 2 seconds): |A|,|B|,N\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSubtask #2 (30 points, time limit 1 second):\n\nthe sum of |A| over all test cases does not exceed 500\nthe sum of |B| over all test cases does not exceed 500\n\nSubtask #3 (50 points, time limit 1 second): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\nhitech\ncodechef\n3\nchef 3\ncode 1\neche 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Chef can buy the string C = "tech" + "echef" = "techechef". In this string C, one substring is "chef", there are no substrings "code" and two substrings are "eche". Chef\'s pleasure in this case is 1\xe2\x8b\x853+0\xe2\x8b\x851+2\xe2\x8b\x855=13, which is the maximum possible pleasure.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85sharepo\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TWOSTRS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Tries, Aho Corasick, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Algorithms, String Matching, Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2702\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-01-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 - 2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
