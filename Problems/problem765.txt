b'\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nYou are an evil sorcerer at a round table with $N$ sorcerers (including yourself). You can cast $M$ spells which have distinct powers $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_M$.\nYou may perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):\n\nAssign a living sorcerer to each positive integer cyclically to your left starting from yourself \xe2\x80\x95 the closest living sorcerer to your left is assigned to $1$, the next living sorcerer to the left is assigned to $2$ and so on. Note that each living sorcerer (including yourself) is assigned to an infinite number of integers.\nChoose a spell $j$ (possibly a spell you have chosen before) and kill the living sorcerer assigned to $p_j$. You may not cast a spell to kill yourself. \n\n\nWhat is the maximum number of sorcerers you can kill using zero or more operations?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.\nThe second line contains $M$ space-separated integers $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_M$.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum number of sorcerers you can kill.\nConstraints\n\n$1 \\le T \\le 1,000$\n$1 \\le N \\le 10^9$\n$1 \\le M \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$\n$1 \\le p_i \\le 10^9$ for each valid $i$\n$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_N$ are pairwise distinct\nthe sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \\cdot 10^5$\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n4 1\n5\n6 2\n2 4\n1 4\n7 16 8 29\n1000000000 1\n998244353\n1 1\n20201220\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n4\n0\n1755647\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The initial state is shown in the figure from the statement. We can first use spell $1$ and kill the $5$-th sorcerer to our left, i.e. sorcerer $2$. Now there are $3$ living sorcerers and the state is as shown in the following figure:\n\nWe can use spell $1$ again and kill the current $5$-th living sorcerer to our left, i.e. sorcerer $4$. Now there are $2$ living sorcerers and the state is:\n\nFinally, we can use spell $1$ again and kill the only other living sorcerer, i.e. sorcerer $3$. Now, none of the other sorcerers are alive. As we cannot cast a spell to kill ourselves, we cannot improve the answer any further.\nExample case 2: We can perform $4$ operations using the spell $p_1 = 2$ each time. We can also instead use $p_2 = 4$ in the first two operations and $p_1 = 2$ in the last two operations. Note that there may be multiple valid sequences of operations that lead to the best answer.\nExample case 3: We cannot perform any operations using any of the given spells, so we are unable to kill any sorcerers.\nExample case 4: We can perform $1,755,647$ operations, each of them using the spell $p_1 = 998,244,353$.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85explodingfrz\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CIRCHAOS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Modular Arithmetic, GCD, Integer Factorisation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2195\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
