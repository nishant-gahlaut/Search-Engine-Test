b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nHenry and Derek are waiting on a room, eager to join the Snackdown 2016 Qualifier Round. They decide to pass the time by playing a game.  \nIn this game's setup, they write N positive integers on a blackboard. Then the players take turns, starting with Henry. In a turn, a player selects one of the integers, divides it by 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, and then takes the floor to make it an integer again. If the integer becomes 0, it is erased from the board. The player who makes the last move wins.  \n\nHenry and Derek are very competitive, so aside from wanting to win Snackdown, they also want to win this game. Assuming they play with the optimal strategy, your task is to predict who wins the game.  \nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of integers they wrote on the board. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the integers themselves.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing either \xe2\x80\x9cHenry\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cDerek\xe2\x80\x9d (without quotes), denoting the winner of the game.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 1018\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n2\n3 4\n3\n1 3 5\n\n\nOutput:\nHenry\nDerek\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. In this test case, the numbers on the board are [3,4]. Henry can win by selecting 4 and then dividing it by 2. The integers on the board are now [3,2]. Derek now has a couple of choices:\n\nDerek can divide 2 by 3, 4, 5 or 6, making it 0 and removing it. Now only one integer remains on the board, 3, and Henry can just divide it by 6 to finish, and win, the game.\nDerek can divide 3 by 4, 5 or 6, making it 0 and removing it. Now only one integer remains on the board, 2, and Henry can just divide it by 6 to finish, and win, the game.\nDerek can divide 2 by 2. Now the integers are [1,3]. Henry can respond by dividing 3 by 3. The integers are now [1,1]. Now Derek has no choice but to divide 1 by 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 and remove it (because it becomes 0). Henry can respond by dividing the remaining 1 by 2 to finish, and win, the game.\nDerek can divide 3 by 2 or 3. Now the integers are [1,2]. Henry can respond by dividing 2 by 2. The integers are now [1,1]. This leads to a situation as in the previous case and Henry wins.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85kevinsogo\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FDIVGAME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Mathematics, Sprague Grundy Theorem\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Game Theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-05-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
