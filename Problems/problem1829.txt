b'\nChef always wanted to travel through time. Chef along with his friend after many years finally made a timetime machinemachine.\nOne day, Chef was working on something inside the machine. Suddenly, due to some technical glitches, he got locked inside.\nFortunately, Chef\xe2\x80\x99s friend was outside. The walls of the machine were made such that sound from inside could not be heard outside and vice versa. So, Chef could not tell his friend the password.\nOn the front side of the machine, there was a space for entering the password.\nThe space was divided into three parts.\nThe first part displayed a sequence of alphabetical letters named cosmos and a number k.\nThe second part displayed a blank line where the password was to be entered.\nThe third part was a keypad which contained numbers 0 to 9.\nOnly Chef knew the exact password of the machine, but he left some clues to his friend.\nAs a security measure, only Chef\xe2\x80\x99s friend can understand it.\nThe clue was as follows:\n\xe2\x80\x9c A barrier has been put at the end of the last letter of the cosmos. Initially barrier size is 0.\nAll left rotations of the cosmos are added in a quantum list. After each rotation the barrier will shift left and increase its size by 1 until barrier size is 1 less than length of cosmos.\nAfter all the rotations in the quantum list are stored, some modifications are made to each one.\nThe letters which are after the barrier are discarded.\nThe number of distinct characters in the relative pattern is the password.\nThe relative pattern is the smallest kth lexicographic sequence from the quantum list.\xe2\x80\x9d   \nCan you help Chef\xe2\x80\x99s friend find this password?\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains two lines of input.\nFirst line contains length of cosmos N and number k.\nSecond line contains the string cosmos of length N.  \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the password.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4N\nall characters of S are lowercase\n\nSample Input:\n1\n6 3\n\ngalaxy \nSample Output:\n5\n\nEXPLANATION:\ngalaxy is the 3rd smallest.
