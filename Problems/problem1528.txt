b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nGritukan likes to take cyclic trips around the world. There are NN countries numbered 1 through N in the world. Before starting his travels, Gritukan chooses a permutation P of all N countries. Then, he visits all countries (some countries may be visited multiple times) using the following algorithm:\n\nfor each v from 1 to N inclusive:\ntravel to country v\ntravel from country v to country Pv, then from country Pv to country PPv, and so on until he reaches country v again; let's call this sequence of visited countries a cyclic route\n\n(Each country appears at most once in a cyclic route. It is also possible for a route to contain only one country if v=Pv, in which case Gritukan's travel along this route consists of staying in country v.)\nUnfortunately, Gritukan does not remember the routes he took. He only remembers a sequence A1..N with the following meaning: for each country v, the number of cyclic routes which contained this country is Av. Given the sequence A, Gritukan asks you to calculate the number of permutations P consistent with this sequence, modulo 998244353 (it's prime).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of possible permutations modulo 998244353 (it's prime).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (40 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45000\nSubtask #2 (60 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n6\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n6\n6 6 6 6 6 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n120\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85altruist_\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FFT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Combinatorics, Convolution, FFT\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algebra, Transformations, Polynomial\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2503\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-04-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
