He likes to draw geometric figures and among them, he especially loves isosceles right triangles. The longest side of a right triangle is called its hypotenuse. Chef drew NN isosceles right triangles (numbered 11 through N) on an infinite sheet of paper, which can be represented by a Cartesian half-plane (containing all points (x,y) such that y\xe2\x89\xa50), in such a way that the hypotenuse of each triangle lies on the x-axis (the line y=0). For example, the resulting figure could look like this:\n\nThe sides of the triangles and the x-axis split the paper into one or more contiguous regions, which Chef calls districts. Chef is fascinated by his drawing, so he would like to know how many districts are on his paper. For each valid i, the hypotenuse of the i-th triangle is the line segment between points (li,0) and (ri,0); note that the triangles are uniquely defined by this information.\nHelp Chef calculate the number of districts in the painting.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nN lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers li and ri.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of districts.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4li<ri\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nthe pairs (l1,r1),(l2,r2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(lN,rN) are distinct\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): N\xe2\x89\xa4103\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4\n40 110\n100 140\n-100 100\n-100 60\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The paper with all triangles and eight numbered districts is shown in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin3\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PAINTERP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Hashmaps, Fenwick Trees, Triangles\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Computational Geometry, Polygons\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2645\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-02-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
