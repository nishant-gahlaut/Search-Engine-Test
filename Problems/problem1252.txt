b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has been invited to be a judge for a cycling race.\nYou may think about cyclists in the race as points on a line. All the cyclists start at the same point with an initial speed of zero. All of them move in the same direction. Some cyclists may force their cycles to speed up. The change of speed takes place immediately. The rest of the time, they move with a constant speed. There are N cyclists in total, numbered from 1 to N.\nIn order to award points to the participants, Chef wants to know how far the cyclists have reached at certain points of time.\nCorresponding to the above two, there will be two types of queries.\n\nChange the speed of cyclist i at some time.\nAsk for the position of the race leader at some time.\n\nThere are Q queries. Each query of first type is described by the type of the query (1), the time Time, the cyclist number cyclist, and the new speed NewSpeed. Each query of second type is described by the type of the query (2), and the time Time.\nInitial speed of all the cyclists is 0.\nInput\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers, N and Q.\nNext Q lines contain queries, one per line. Each line constists of several space-separated integers. First integer is Type, it is either 1 or 2 denoting the type of the query. If the type of the query is 1, then three integers follow: Time, cyclist and NewSpeed. If the type of the query is 2, then one integer follows: Time. All the queries are sorted by time, e.g., value Time of the next query is greater or equeal than value Time for current query.\nOutput\nOutput integers A1, A2, \xe2\x80\xa6 , AR each in a separate line. Here Ai is the answer for the ith query of type 2 in the current test case and R is the total number of queries of this type in the test case.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 50000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Time \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 NewSpeed \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 cyclist \xe2\x89\xa4 N\nThe speed of any cyclist cannot decrease.\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 [25 points]: N \xe2\x89\xa4 5000 and Q \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\nSubtask #2 [75 points]: No additional constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5 14\n1 1 1 2\n1 1 2 5\n1 2 3 4\n1 2 4 7\n2 3\n2 4\n1 5 5 4\n2 5\n2 6\n1 7 5 8\n2 7\n2 8\n2 9\n2 10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n10\n15\n21\n28\n35\n42\n49\n56\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85cenadar\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85antoniuk1\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CYCLRACE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Segment Trees, Convex Hull, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Computational Geometry, Polygons, Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2316\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-09-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
