b'\n"It doesn\'t matter how tough you are, you are not going to win on your own."\nNN players advance to the 2nd round, the game is revealed to be "HoneyComb". \nThe players have to construct an array AA. Each and every player is given "Ppopgi" (Dalgona candy),\nand the iith player has to carve a number AiAi in their "Ppopgi".\nThe players will qualify if the array AA satisfies the following rules:\n\nThe sum of the squares of all the numbers carved should be a perfect square. Formally, \xe2\x88\x91i=1n(Ai)2\xe2\x88\x91i=1n(Ai)2 = K2K2 , where KK is a natural number.\nThe number of distinct values in the array should not exceed min(10,N)min(10,N).\n\nGi-Hun wants everyone to qualify, so he asks you for help. Help him find an array AA which satisfies these conditions.\nIf there are multiple arrays that satisfy the conditions, you may find any of them.\nNote: NN can be large enough that the array cannot be printed directly. Instead, describe the array in terms of its frequencies, i.e, print (value,frequency)(value,frequency) pairs, where each pair suggests the number of times the value occurs in the array. If this is unclear, please look at the sample inputs and outputs.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of inputs contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NN, the length of the array to be constructed.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print the array AA you construct in the following format: \n\nThe first line should contain a single integer KK, the number of distinct values in the array AA \n(1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min(10,N)1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min(10,N)).\nThe next KK lines hold the description of the array. The ithith of these lines should contain two integers xixi and yiyi, denoting that xixi occurs exactly yiyi times in AA.\n\nThe pairs (xi,yi)(xi,yi) should satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4109 and yi\xe2\x89\xa51yi\xe2\x89\xa51 for every 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4K1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4K\nThe xixi must be pairwise distinct, i.e, xi\xe2\x89\xa0xjxi\xe2\x89\xa0xj if i\xe2\x89\xa0ji\xe2\x89\xa0j\nThe sum of yiyi must be NN, i.e, \xe2\x88\x91Ki=1yi=N\xe2\x88\x91i=1Kyi=N\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1\n5\n6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n1 1\n3\n2 2\n3 1\n4 2\n4\n2 2\n3 1\n4 2\n24 1\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 2: 22 occurs 22 times, 33 occurs once, and 44 occurs 22 times in AA. The sum of squares is thus 22+22+32+42+42=4922+22+32+42+42=49, which is 7272.\nTest Case 3: 22 occurs twice, 33 occurs once, 44 occurs twice, and 2424 occurs once in AA. The sum of squares is 22+22+32+42+42+242=62522+22+32+42+42+242=625, which is 252252.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85lightspeed11\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DALGONA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Arithmetic, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Basic Maths, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2286\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-12-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
