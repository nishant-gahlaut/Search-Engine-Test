At the end of the game, a group of contiguous people will be awarded with prize money, if the sum of points of them is maximum. Chef want to know the maximum sum.\n Note : Group can be consist of any number between 1 to N inclusive.\nInput\n\n First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n Each testcase contains of a two lines of input, First line will contain, number of people including chef.\nSecond line will contain array of number A1,A2,A3,..........,ANA1,A2,A3,..........,AN denoting the points of each player at the end of game. \n\n Output \n\nFor each testcase, output in a single line containing maximum contiguous group sum.\n\nConstraints \n\n 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000 \n 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4104\n 0\xe2\x89\xa4|Ai|\xe2\x89\xa41050\xe2\x89\xa4|Ai|\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSample Input:\n1\n5\n 1 2 3 4 5\nSample Output:\n15\nEXPLANATION:\n Maximum contiguous sum can be possible with 1,2,3,4,51,2,3,4,5 \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85dshahid380_\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHGM1\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 array, dshahid380_, easy, encoding, kadane-algorithm\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-02-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
