b"\nThere is a tree with NN nodes numbered from 11 to  NN outside Harshikaa's house. The tree is rooted at node 11. Initially the tree was dry, there were no raindrops on any node of the tree. Suddenly it started raining, and every second a drop falls on all the leaf nodes of the tree. Also, every second any drop which wasn't already on the root node moves one node closer to the root.\nSometimes, strong winds shake the tree and all drops which were not on the root fall off. It is known that the wind will shake the tree MM times at A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6AMA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6AM seconds after it started raining. \nIf multiple events happen at the same second, they are in this order:\n\nRaindrops move one node closer to the root.\nNew raindrops fall on the leaves.\nWind shakes the tree.\n\nHow many drops are there at the root right after the MM-th shake?\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of each input contains TT - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM - the number of nodes on the tree and the number of shake events.\nN\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 lines follow, each line containing two space-separated integers UU and VV denoting an edge between node UU and VV on the tree.\nThe next line contains MM space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AMA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AM - the timestamp of the shakes.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line the number of raindrops on the root right after the MM-th shake.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4U,V\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4U,V\xe2\x89\xa4N\nU\xe2\x89\xa0VU\xe2\x89\xa0V\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\nAA is strictly increasing\nSum of NN over all test cases is not more than 5\xe2\x8b\x851055\xe2\x8b\x85105\nSum of MM over all test cases is not more than 4\xe2\x8b\x851054\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5 2\n2 1\n1 3\n4 3\n3 5\n2 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nExplanation\n\nTest case 11: Let's define an array RR, where RiRi is the number of raindrops on the ii-th node.\n\nAt second 00, R=[0,0,0,0,0]R=[0,0,0,0,0].\nAt second 11, a raindrop fell on all leaves. RR becomes [0,1,0,1,1][0,1,0,1,1].\nAt second 22,\n\nFirstly, raindrops moved closer to the root, so RR becomes [1,0,2,0,0][1,0,2,0,0].\nSecondly, a raindrop fell on all leaves, so RR becomes [1,1,2,1,1][1,1,2,1,1].\nThirdly, the tree was shook, so every raindrop except the one on root fell. At the end of second 22, R=[1,0,0,0,0]R=[1,0,0,0,0].\nAt second 33, new raindrops fell, and RR becomes [1,1,0,1,1][1,1,0,1,1].\nAt second 44, RR becomes [2,1,2,1,1][2,1,2,1,1].\nAt second 55,\n\nFirstly, raindrops moved closer to the root, so RR becomes [5,0,2,0,0][5,0,2,0,0].\nSecondly, a raindrop fell on all leaves, so RR becomes [5,1,2,1,1][5,1,2,1,1].\nThirdly, the tree was shook, so every raindrop except the one on root fell. At the end of second 55, R=[5,0,0,0,0]R=[5,0,0,0,0].\n\nTherefore, at the end there were 55 drops at the root.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85vishesh_s\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RAINDROPS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 depth-first-search, depth-first-search, depth-first-search, easy, easy, easy, exun2021, exun2021, exun2021, graphs, graphs, graphs, vishesh_s\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2506\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-01-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
