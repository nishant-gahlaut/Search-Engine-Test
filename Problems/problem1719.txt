b"\nIndiana Jones has finally found Atlantis and he also discovered some manuscripts that can decipher\nAtlantean language. Strangely Atlantean language alphabets are the same as English language alphabets. The Atlantean manuscript contains N unique words. (numbered from 1).\nIndiana has also discovered a device that displays a single alphabet per second for a total of $Q$ seconds. At each second, Indiana tries to figure out if the string formed by some of the consecutive alphabets shown by the device until then, spell any of the word present in the list. In case he finds a word, he prints $F(String)$\nwhere, \n$F(String)$ is $0$, if the position(string) in manuscript is $odd$,\n                   and it is $1$, if the position(string) in manuscript is $even$.\nat each second Indiana can find multiple words from the list in which case, shorter words get their f(string) calculated first. \nNote: a word consisting of q(i\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6j) can be taken only once. If the same word is found in another position, then it can be added to output again.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain $N$, number of words in the list. \nThe next line will contain $N$ space separated words.\nThe next line contains $Q$ representing the number of alphabets spit out by the machine\nThe following $Q$ lines will each have a single alphabet. \n\nOutput:\nOutput the string that represents the message. Its is guaranteed that at least 1 word will be found\nConstraints\n\n$1 \\leq N \\leq 10000$\n$1 \\leq |word|  \\leq 100$\n$1 \\leq Q \\leq 10^6$\nEach q is a single lowercase english alphabet.\n\nPlease use fast I/O to take input. \nSample Input:\nSample test case 1:\n\n2\nabc ced\n10\nx\nx\nx\na\nb\nc\ne\nd\nl\nl\n\n\nSample test case 2:\n\n2\nbabc abc\n4\nb\na\nb\nc\n\nSample Output:\nSample test case 1:\n01\n\nSample test case 2:\n10\n\nEXPLANATION:\nIn the first example, word 'abc' and 'ced' was there in the list of alphabets spit out. Hence output 01.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85arnie8991\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ECAUG208\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 arnie8991, enau2020, medium, trie\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-08-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
