b"\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nGintoki has been very lazy recently and he hasn't made enough money to pay the rent this month. So the old landlady has given him a problem to solve instead, if he can solve this problem the rent will be waived. \nThe problem is as follows:\nA triplet of integers (A,B,C) is considered to be special if it satisfies the following properties for a given integer N :\n\nAmodB=C\nBmodC=0\n1 \\le A, B, C \\le N\n\nExample: There are three special triplets for N = 3.\n\n(1, 3, 1) is a special triplet, since (1 \\bmod 3) = 1 and (3 \\bmod 1) = 0. \n(1, 2, 1) is a special triplet, since (1 \\bmod 2) = 1 and (2 \\bmod 1) = 0.\n(3, 2, 1) is a special triplet, since (3 \\bmod 2) = 1 and (2 \\bmod 1) = 0.\n\nThe landlady gives Gintoki an integer N. Now Gintoki needs to find the number of special triplets. Can you help him to find the answer?\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N. \n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the number of special triplets.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \\leq T \\leq 10\n2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (5 points): 2 \\le N \\le 10^3\nSubtask #2 (20 points): 2 \\le N \\le 10^4\nSubtask #3 (75 points):  Original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n4\n5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n6\n9\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: It is explained in the problem statement.\nTest case 2: The special triplets are (1, 3, 1), (1, 2, 1), (3, 2, 1), (1, 4, 1),  (4, 3, 1), (2, 4, 2). Hence the answer is 6.\nTest case 3: The special triplets are (1, 3, 1), (1, 2, 1), (3, 2, 1), (1, 4, 1), (4, 3, 1), (1, 5, 1), (5, 4, 1), (5, 2, 1), (2, 4, 2). Hence the answer is 9.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85nlather\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SPCTRIPS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sieve of Eratosthenes\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1673\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-04-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
