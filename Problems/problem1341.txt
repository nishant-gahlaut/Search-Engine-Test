b'\nRead problems statements in mandarin chinese, russian and vietnamese as well.\n\nChang was not able to sleep well last night as he was thinking about a problem which still remains unsolved. Since he has only a day left to solve this problem and hand it to the interviewer, you being his friend decide to help him solve this so that he can clear this round and get a much-needed job. The problem is as follows.\n\nGiven a list L of N integers, Chang defines a perfect quadruple (i, j, k, l) such that:\n\ni, j, k, l are the indices of the list\ni \xe2\x89\xa4 j < k \xe2\x89\xa4 l\n\n\n\nYou need to find the summation of F(i, j, k, l) over all perfect quadruples (i, j, k, l).\nF(i, j, k, l) is calculated as the product of maximum element in range [i, j] and the minimum element in range [k, l]. Since, the answer can be large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7. \n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer N denoting the number of elements in the list.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers L1, L2, ..., LN denoting the elements of the list.\nOutput\nOuput an integer corresponding to the answer to the only test case in a line.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4  106\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Li \xe2\x89\xa4  109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 1 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\nExplanation\n\nThe perfect Quadruples and their individual contribution is calculated as.\n\nF(1, 1, 2, 2) = 2*1 = 2\nF(1, 1, 2, 3) = 2*1 = 2\nF(1, 1, 3, 3) = 2*3 = 6\nF(1, 2, 3, 3) = 2*3 = 6\nF(2, 2, 3, 3) = 1*3 = 3\n\n\n\nAll these values sum up to 19.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85prateekg603\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHNGSUM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Stacks, Observation, Binary Search, Prefix Sum, Subarray, Range Minimum Queries\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms, Searching, Simple Algos, Groupings, Queries\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-06-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
