b"\nRead problem statements in Mandarin, Vietnamese, and Russian as well.\nYou and Paolo are playing a game.\nPaolo, without letting you peek, writes down on a sheet of paper an N\xc3\x97N matrix of 0s and 1s (all the N2 entries are either 0 or 1) such that, for each 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4N, there is a row with exactly k ones. In all tests, N=50.\nYour goal is to find the row with exactly \xe2\x8c\x8aN2\xe2\x8c\x8b ones.\nIn order to do it, you may ask the following kind of question to Paolo:  Paolo, what's the value in the i-th row and j-th column? \nThe question is valid if 1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4N.\nYou have to play T=500 games and, in total, you can ask at most 610T questions.\nInteraction Format\nFirst, read two integers T (T=500) and N (N=50). They are fixed but still provided, just for your comfort.\nNow, you start playing games. As soon as you give the answer to a game you should immediately start playing the next one.\nTo ask a question (of the kind described in the statement), you should print '? i j' (without quotes). After this, you should read an integer, the value of the entry in the i-th row and j-th column. A question is valid if 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N and 1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4N.\nWhen you have identified the row with exactly \xe2\x8c\x8aN2\xe2\x8c\x8b ones, you should print '! i' (without quotes), where i is the index of the row (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N).\nIf you perform a malformed query, or you identify a row that does not have \xe2\x8c\x8aN2\xe2\x8c\x8b ones, the interactor terminates immediately and your program receives verdict Wrong Answer. If you ask more than 610T questions, the interaction continues until you have played all the games and then your program receives a verdict Wrong Answer.\nA program in C++ which uses cin and cout (and flushes the output after every question) needs \xe2\x89\x88700ms to perform 610T=305000 questions (considering only the time spent interacting).\nThe interactor is not adaptive (i.e., the T matrices are chosen before the beginning of the interaction).\nNote\nInstead of providing a sample case that shows the interaction, we provide an implementation in C++  of a program that performs the interaction correctly and answers correctly (but it makes too many questions and therefore receives a verdict Wrong Answer).\nConstraints\n\nT=500\nN=50\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85dario2994\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GUESSROW\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Interactive Problems, Randomized Algorithms, Probability, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Special, Advanced Algorithms, Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3031\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-11-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
