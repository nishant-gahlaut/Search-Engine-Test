He wants to fill each of its cells with a random integer between 1 and K (inclusive); these integers are independent.\nThen, Chef builds a directed graph on this matrix: for each ordered pair of side-adjacent cells of the matrix such that the value in the first cell is greater than or equal to the value in the second cell, he adds an edge from the first cell to the second cell.\nFind the expected value of the number of strongly connected components (SCC) in this graph. It can be proved that the answer can be represented as a fraction P/Q, where P and Q are positive integers and Q is coprime with 998,244,353. You should compute P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 998,244,353, where Q\xe2\x88\x921 denotes the multiplicative inverse of Q modulo 998,244,353.\nInput\n\nThe first and only line of the input contains three space-separated integers M, N and K.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing one integer P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 998,244,353.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa42\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4108\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (5 points, time limit 1s):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa44\nK\xe2\x89\xa45 \n\nSubtask #2 (10 points, time limit 2s): M=1\nSubtask #3 (10 points, time limit 2s):\n\nM=2\nN\xe2\x89\xa4500\nK\xe2\x89\xa4500\n\nSubtask #4 (75 points, time limit 3s): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2 2 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n873463811\n\n\nExplanation\nThe total number of ways to fill the matrix is 16. We get:\n\n1 SCC with a probability 2/16\n2 SCCs with a probability 12/16\n3 SCCs with a probability 0/16\n4 SCCs with a probability 2/16\n\nThe expected number of SCCs is 2/16+24/16+8/16=34/16=34\xe2\x8b\x8516\xe2\x88\x921=873463811.
