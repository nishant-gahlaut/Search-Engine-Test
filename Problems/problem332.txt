Now, Alice is thinking about what to give Chef as a present. She should obviously choose a sequence \xe2\x80\x95 what could possibly be a better birthday gift than a sequence!\nAfter some thinking, Alice chose a sequence of integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. However, she does not want to simply give this sequence to Chef. Instead, she decided to give Chef a sequence B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BNB1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN, where Bi=\xe2\x8b\x81ij=1AjBi=\xe2\x8b\x81j=1iAj for each valid ii and \xe2\x8b\x81\xe2\x8b\x81 denotes the bitwise OR operation. Chef can try to generate a sequence AA from BB, but there could be more than one such possible sequence.\nNow, Alice is wondering how many sequences AA correspond to the given sequence BB. Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo 109+7109+7. Note that it is not guaranteed that the given sequence BB was generated from some sequence AA.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BNB1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of possible sequences AA modulo 109+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4251\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa425\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851041\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85104\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Bi<2300\xe2\x89\xa4Bi<230 for each valid ii\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2\n2 3\n4\n2 6 7 7\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n64\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: There are two possible options for AA: (2,1)(2,1) and (2,3)(2,3).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85ezio_26\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MYSARA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 basic, bit-manipulation, combinatorics, cook116, easy, ezio_26, tmwilliamlin\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1939\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-03-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
