b"\nChef is playing a game, which he starts with a score of S=0S=0. He also has an integer N.\nIn one move, Chef does the following:\n\nUniformly randomly pick an integer X between 0 and 2N\xe2\x88\x921 (inclusive of both ends)\nUpdate his score as S\xe2\x86\x92S\xe2\x88\xa3X, where \xe2\x88\xa3 denotes the bitwise OR operation\n\nFor example, if Chef's current score is S=6 and he picks X=10, his new score is 6\xe2\x88\xa310=14.\nChef stops when his score S becomes equal to 2N\xe2\x88\x921.  What is the expected number of moves Chef performs?\nOutput the answer modulo 109+7. That is, the answer can be expressed as a fraction P/Q, where gcd(Q,109+7)=1. Print P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921(mod\xc2\xa0109+7), where Q\xe2\x88\x921 denotes the modular multiplicative inverse of Q with respect to 109+7.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nEach test case contains a single integer N.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output on a new line the expected number of moves Chef performs, modulo 109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105\nSum of N over all test cases do not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask 1 (30 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\nSum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 103\n\nSubtask 2 (70 points):\n\nOriginal constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1\n2\n100\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n666666674\n328238032\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: In each move, Chef chooses either 0 or 1, each with a probability of 1/2. The game ends as soon as Chef chooses 1. Thus, the probability that the game takes exactly k moves is 2\xe2\x88\x92k.\nThe required expected value is then \xe2\x88\x9e\xe2\x88\x91k=1k\xe2\x8b\x852\xe2\x88\x92k, which equals 2. \nTest case 2: In each move, Chef chooses an integer in [0,3]. The answer is 8/3.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nutkarsh_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RANDOMOR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 binomial-theorem, expected-value, feb221, geometric-progression, medium, probability, utkarsh_adm\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2891\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-01-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
