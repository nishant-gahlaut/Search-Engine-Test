b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nThe Baratheons have been ruling in the Seven Kingdoms for many years. They have seen a lot: prosperity and hunger, tranquility and rebellions, live and death. But nevertheless, they still hold the throne.\nKing Joffrey Baratheon's reign is running now. As a wise man, he honors the history of his family. So, he commanded to build up two monuments, that will remind about some historical periods of the Baratheons.\nFormally, the Baratheons have been ruling for N years. Every year is described by an integer Ai, the level of prosperity in i-th year. If i-th year was a great year, then Ai might be a positive integer. Otherwise, if i-th year was a horrible year, then Ai might be a negative integer.\nEach historical period can be described as two integers S and F, the start and the finish of the period respectively. Of course, S is not greater than F for each period, that we consider in this task.\nYou are to pick two historical periods, but there are some rules:\nTwo periods shouldn't have common years. I.e. a period [1, 5] has no common years with a period [6, 7];\nThe first period should start earlier than the second one. I.e. a period [1, 5] starts earlier than [6, 7];\nTwo periods shouldn't be too close to each other. There must be at least K years between the finish of the first period and the start of the second period. I.e. periods [1, 5] and [10, 10] can be chosen in case K equals to 4, while they can't in case K equals to 5.\nThe sum of the levels of prosperity in chosen years should be as big as possible.\n\n\nAfterwards, you should report the sum of the levels of prosperity in chosen years to your King. Make everything right, otherwise King Joffrey won't be merciful!\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers N and K denoting the length of the Baratheons' reign and the minimal amount of years between two chosen periods.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the levels of prosperity in corresponding years.\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the required integer.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5;\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105;\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 105;\n-109 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109 for every 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N;\nK + 2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n\xc2\xa0\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n5 3\n-1 1 2 3 -1\n8 3\n5 5 -1 -2 3 -1 2 -2\n6 0\n5 -1 5 0 -1 9\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n-2\n12\n18\n\n\nExplanation\nThere are T = 3 test cases the input.\nThe first test case: N equals to 5, K equals to 3, A[] equals to {-1, 1, 2, 3, -1}. There is the only option: we have to choose [1, 1] and [5, 5] periods.\nThe second test case: N equals to 8, K equals to 3, A[] equals to {5, 5, -1, -2, 3, -1, 2, -2}. It is optimal to choose [1, 2] and [7, 7] periods. That is the only optimal choice that you can make.\nThe second test case: N equals to 6, K equals to 0, A[] equals to {5, -1, 5, 0, -1, 9}. It is optimal to choose [1, 3] and [6, 6] periods. But that is not the only optimal choice that you can make.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kostya_by\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85white_king\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/REIGN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bottom-up\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, DP Approach\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1855\n\n\nDate Added:\n6-11-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
