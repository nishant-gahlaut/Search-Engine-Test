b'\n\nDid you know that the Hindus believe there are 330 million deities ? Lets discuss about them in long contests. The three main forces of god Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh, also called Trimurti ( 3 forms ), want to decide when to end the world. Given an array A, which contains the \'Good\' ( or \'Evil\' ) score of each place on earth, they can easily find the maximum sum of the scores of a (contiguous) sub-array of places. But this is not much useful to them. So, each of them gives a value K and want to know the Kth maximum sum of scores of a contiguous sub-array. In other words, find the value of S[K] (1-based index), where the array S contains the sums of all possible contiguous sub-arrays in non-increasing order.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line contains T, number of test cases. T cases follow. In each test case, first line contains N K1 K2 K3. Next line contains N space separated integers.\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the K1th, K2th and K3th maximum sum in a single line, separated by a single space. See sample cases and explanation for more clarity.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 3\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K1 < K2 < K3 \xe2\x89\xa4 2012\nK3 \xe2\x89\xa4 N*(N+1)/2\n-10000 \xe2\x89\xa4 A[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 10000Note : There are multiple test sets, and the judge shows the sum of the time taken over all test sets of your submission, if Accepted.\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3 1 2 3\n10 20 30\n3 3 4 6\n10 20 30\n4 2 6 10\n20 -15 10 -15\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n60 50 30\n30 30 10\n15 -5 -20\n\n\nExplanation\n                    Case 1 & 2 : A = { 10, 20, 30 }.
