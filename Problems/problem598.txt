b'\nA Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv likes lucky strings, i.e., the strings that consist only of the lucky digits 4 and 7.\nThe Little Elephant has K favorite lucky strings A1, A2, ..., AK. He thinks that the lucky string S is good if either |S| \xe2\x89\xa5 47 or for some j from 1 to K we have that  Aj is a substring of S.\nThe Little Elephant has found N lucky strings B1, B2, ..., BN under the pillow. Now he wants to know which of them are good. Help him and find for each i from 1 to N whether the string Bi is good or not.\nNotes.\n\nLet S be some lucky string. Then\n\n|S| denotes the length of the string S;\n\nS[i] (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 |S|) denotes the ith character of S (the numeration of characters starts from 1);\n\nThe string T of the length M is called a substring of S if for some k from 0 to |S| - M we have T[1] = S[k + 1], T[2] = S[k + 2], ..., T[M] = S[k + M].\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input file contains two integers K and N, the number of favorite lucky strings of the Little Elephant and the number of strings he has found under the pillow. Each of the following K lines contains one favorite lucky string. Namely, jth line among these K lines contains the string Aj. Each of the following N lines contains one lucky string that was found under the pillow. Namely, ith line among these N lines contains the string Bi. The input file does not contain any whitespaces.\nOutput\nFor each of the N strings that were found under the pillow print Good if it is good, and Bad otherwise.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K, N \xe2\x89\xa4 50\nFor each string S in the input file we have 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4 50.\nEach string in the input file consists only of the lucky digits 4 and 7.\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2 4\n47\n744\n7444\n447\n7774\n77777777777777777777777777777777777777777777774\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nGood\nGood\nBad\nGood\n\n\nExplanation\nThe string S = 7444 is good since the favorite string 744 is its substring.\nThe string S = 447 is good since the favorite string 47 is its substring.\nThe string S = 7774 is bad since none of the favorite strings 47 and 744 is a substring of S.\nThe string S = 77777777777777777777777777777777777777777777774 is good since its length is 47. Note, however, that S does not have favorite substrings at all.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85witaliy_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85anton_lunyov\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LUCKYSTR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, KMP Algorithm, Rabin Karp Algorithm, Z Algorithm, Aho Corasick, Brute Force\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Advanced Algorithms, String Matching, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1166\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-03-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.391892 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
