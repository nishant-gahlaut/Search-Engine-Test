In this problem, we\'ll deal with a similar game, which we\'ll call Dual Nim. The rules of this game are as follows:\n\nInitially, there are N piles of stones, numbered 1 through N. The i-th pile contains ai stones.\nThe players take alternate turns. If the bitwise XOR of all piles equals 0 before a player\'s turn, then that player wins the game.\nIn his/her turn, a player must choose one of the remaining piles and remove it. (Note that if there are no piles, that player already won.)\n\nDecide which player wins, given that both play optimally.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains N - the number of piles.\nThe following line contains N space-separated integers a1,..,aN - the sizes of piles.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output one string on a separate line - "First" (without quotes) if the first player wins, "Second" (without quotes) if the second player wins.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 500\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ai \xe2\x89\xa4 500\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n4\n1 2 4 8\n3\n2 3 3\n5\n3 3 3 3 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFirst\nSecond\nSecond\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85xellos0\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85antoniuk1\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TWONIM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bitwise Operation, nim game, ad-hoc, Patterns\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Bit Manipulation, Algorithms, Game Theory, Constructive, Observation\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2031\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-01-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
