b'\nRead problem statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are nn climbers, numbered 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n, taking part in the sport climbing final at the olympic games and you are a fan of athlete 1.\nA climbing competition features three contests, one for each discipline: speed, bouldering, and lead.\nFor each of the three disciplines, all the n athletes compete in the respective contest and they are ranked, depending on their performance, from 1-st to n-th (there are no ties).\nAt the end, the score of each athlete is the product of his three ranking positions.\nThe final ranking is obtained ordering, nondecreasingly, athletes by score (e.g., the winner is the one with the smallest score).\nTo take care of equal scores, we say that an athlete has final ranking equal to r if there are exactly r\xe2\x88\x921 other athletes with a strictly smaller score (notice that distinct athletes may have the same final ranking).\nCurrently the competition is ongoing. The speed and bouldering contests have finished, but only some athletes have taken part in the lead contest so the ranking for the lead is partial (i.e., only some athletes are ranked and their ranking may change as other athletes still have to compete). For example, if n=3 and the current lead ranking is [3,1] (athlete 3 is first, athlete 1 is second, athlete 2 has not competed yet); the final possible lead rankings are [2,3,1], [3,2,1], and [3,1,2].\nWhat is the best final ranking that athlete 1 can have at the end of the competition?\nInput Format\n\nFirst line contains t \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains the two integers n,m \xe2\x80\x94 the number of climbers and the number of climbers who have already taken part in the lead contest.\nThe second line contains n integers s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sn \xe2\x80\x94 the ranking of the speed contest. In particular si is the athlete who ranked i-th in the speed contest.\nThe third line contains n integers b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn \xe2\x80\x94 the ranking of the bouldering contest. In particular bi is the athlete who ranked i-th in the bouldering contest. \nThe fourth line contains m integers l1,l2,\xe2\x80\xa6,lm \xe2\x80\x94 the current ranking of the lead contest. In particular li is the athlete who is currently ranked i-th in the lead contest.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print the best final ranking that athlete 1 can have at the end of the competition.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa45000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45000\nThe sum of n over all test cases is at most 5000.\nThe array s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sn is a permutation of 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n.\nThe array b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn is a permutation of 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n.\n1\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4n for all i=1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,m.\nli\xe2\x89\xa0lj for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4m.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8\n1 1\n1\n1\n1\n3 3\n1 2 3\n2 3 1\n3 1 2\n5 1\n3 4 2 1 5\n4 1 5 2 3\n1\n4 2\n2 4 1 3\n2 4 1 3\n3 1\n4 2\n3 2 4 1\n4 2 3 1\n3 2\n4 2\n4 2 3 1\n4 1 2 3\n1 3\n7 4\n7 5 1 3 2 6 4\n3 6 4 1 2 7 5\n6 4 5 1\n7 6\n4 3 6 7 1 2 5\n5 3 7 4 6 2 1\n1 7 4 2 5 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n3\n3\n2\n4\n4\n\n\nExplanation\n\nExplanation of test case 1: There is only athlete 1, who has already taken part in the lead contest. His ranking positions in the three contests are 1, 1, 1, hence is final score is 1 and he gets final ranking position 1.\n\n\nExplanation of test case 2:  There are 3 athletes and all of them have already taken part in the lead contest. Their scores are:\n\n Athlete 1 has final score of 1\xe2\x8b\x853\xe2\x8b\x852=6. Indeed his speed ranking is 1, his bouldering ranking is 3, and his lead ranking is 2. \n Athlete 2 has final score of 2\xe2\x8b\x851\xe2\x8b\x853=6. Indeed his speed ranking is 2, his bouldering ranking is 1, and his lead ranking is 3. \n Athlete 3 has final score of 3\xe2\x8b\x852\xe2\x8b\x851=6. Indeed his speed ranking is 3, his bouldering ranking is 2, and his lead ranking is 1. \nAll the athletes have final score equal to 6, hence all of them (and in particular athlete 1) get final ranking position 1. \n\nExplanation of test case 3 There are 5 athletes and only athlete 1 has already taken part in the lead contest. The best final ranking positions for athlete 1 is 1 and can be achieved if the lead ranking in the end is 1,2,3,4,5.\nWith this lead ranking, the final scores of the 5 athletes would be (in order): 8,24,15,8,65. Since athlete 1 has the minimum score (tying with athlete 4), his final ranking position is 1.\n\n\nExplanation of test case 4: There are 4 athletes; athletes 1 and 3 have already taken part in the lead contest with 3 being ranked first and 1 being ranked second. Let us describe some (not necessarily possible) lead rankings:\n\n The lead ranking 1,3,2,4 is impossible since it is not consistent with the current lead ranking (athlete 1 and 3 appear in a different order in the current ranking). \n The lead ranking 3,1,2,4 is consistent with the current lead ranking. In this case, the final scores of the athletes would be (in order) 18,3,16,16; hence athlete 1 would get final ranking equal to 4 (that is, he would be last). \n The lead ranking 2,4,3,1 is consistent with the current lead ranking. In this case, the final scores of the athletes would be (in order) 36,1,48,8; hence athlete 1 would get final ranking equal to 3 (and this is the best possible final ranking). \n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85dario2994\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CLIMBINGRANK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dario2994, medium, snckfl21, snckfp21\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-01-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n4 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
