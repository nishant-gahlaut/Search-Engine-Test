b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Bengali as well.\nChef gives you an array A of length N, consisting of integers. He asks you to choose a subarray with at least 2 elements of the given array. Following, out of your chosen subarray, Chef will pick out any two elements. \nYour net score would be the sum of the remaining elements of the subarray. Obviously, Chef adopts a strategy to minimize your score. Find the maximum score you can have.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains T denoting the number of test cases.\nEach test case is as follows:  \nThe first line contains N denoting the size of the array.  \nThe second line contains N space-separated integers denoting the contents of the array A.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output a single integer denoting your maximum score.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\nThe sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n6\n6 -7 5 9 1 -1\n5\n-1 1 1 1 -1\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n2\n1 2\n10\n-1 4 4 4 0 2 0 0 -1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n6\n0\n7\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: you choose subarray [5,9,1], and Chef chooses elements 5 and 9. So your net score is 1.\nTest case 2: you choose subarray [1,1,1], and Chef chooses elements 1 and 1. So your net score is 1.\nTest case 3: you choose subarray [1,2,3,4,5], and Chef chooses elements 5 and 4. So your net score is 1+2+3=6.\nTest case 4: you can only choose the subarray [1,2], and Chef chooses elements 1 and 2. So your net score is 0 as no elements remain in your chosen subarray.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85watch24hrs\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/C2C\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Monotonic stack, Segment Trees, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Stacks, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2782\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-08-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
