No two of these intervals overlap \xe2\x80\x94 formally, for each valid ii, jj such that i\xe2\x89\xa0ji\xe2\x89\xa0j, either Ri<LjRi<Lj or Rj<LiRj<Li.\nMM people (numbered 11 through MM) are planning to eat at the restaurant; let's denote the time when the ii-th person arrives by PiPi. If the restaurant is open at that time, this person does not have to wait, but if it is closed, this person will wait until it is open. Note that if this person arrives at an exact time when the restaurant is closing, they have to wait for the next opening time.\nFor each person, calculate how long they have to wait (possibly 00 time), or determine that they will wait forever for the restaurant to open.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.\nNN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers LiLi and RiRi.\nMM lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains a single integer PiPi.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print MM lines. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines should contain a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the time person ii has to wait, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if person ii has to wait forever.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Li<Ri\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Li<Ri\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\nthe intervals are pairwise disjoint\nthe sum of NN for all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of MM for all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n\nthe sum of NN for all test cases does not exceed 1,0001,000\nthe sum of MM for all test cases does not exceed 1,0001,000\n\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4 5\n5 7\n9 10\n2 3\n20 30\n5\n6\n7\n35\n1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n2\n-1\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nQuery 11: The person coming at time 55 does not have to wait as the restaurant is open in [5,7)[5,7) slot.\nQuery 22: The person coming at time 66 does not have to wait as the restaurant is open in [5,7)[5,7) slot.\nQuery 33: The person coming at time 77 has to wait since the restaurant is closed at time 77.
