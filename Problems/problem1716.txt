b"\nChef has recently taken up marksmanship, but he's not very good at it.\nChef has set up a number of targets in a line.\nWhen Chef shoots at a target, he may hit the target, but he may instead hit\nthe target to the left, or the target to the right\n(or if there is no such target, miss completely).\nChef knows the probability of his shot going straight, left, or right,\nand wants to hit each target at least once using as few shots as possible.\nHelp Chef determine the expected number of shots required, provided an optimal strategy is followed.\nNote that Chef may only shoot at targets, but may shoot at a target that's already been hit.\nInput\nInput will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases.\nEach test case will consist of 4 integers:\nN, the number of targets,\nL, the probability of the shot veering to the left,\nS, the probability of the shot going straight,\nand R, the probability of the shot veering to the right.\nL, S, and R are given as percents.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the expected number of shots to hit all targets, rounded to 6 decimal places.\n\nSample Input\n4\n3 25 50 25\n3 10 10 80\n5 25 50 25\n8 30 35 35\n\nSample Output\n4.666667\n10.361111\n7.541667\n13.107725\n\n\nIn the first example, Chef shoots at the center target until any 2 targets have been hit,\nthen he shoots at the remaining target.\nConstraints\n\nT\xe2\x89\xa430\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa418\n0<L,S,R\nL+S+R=100\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndavid_adm\n\n\nTester:\n4\xe2\x98\x85chmel_tolstiy\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TARPRACT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DP Bitmask, Probability, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2573\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-09-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.56 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
