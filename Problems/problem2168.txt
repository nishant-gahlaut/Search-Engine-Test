b"\nThe exciting World Cup 2010's summer is coming! And Johnny's family shop is busy preparing a colorful lighting board for the summer.\nThe board has a rectangular shape of size M x N. There are certain positions on the board which Johnny wants to put in light bulbs.\nJohnny wants to decorate the board by colorful light bulbs. To make the board look attractive, he wants the bulbs in the same column or row to have different colors! On the other hand, to preserve the harmony look, Johnny doesn't want the bulbs to have many different colors.\nWrite a program to help Johnny decorate the boards in such a way that the number of color used is minimum.\nInput\nThe first line contains a number t (about 15), the number of test cases. Each test case has the following form.\nThe first line contains two numbers m, n (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 m, n \xe2\x89\xa4 700). Each line in the next m lines contains n characters \n'0' or '1' representing the board, in which '1' denotes a place which Johnny wants to put in a light bulb.\nEach test case's input is separated by a blank line.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print the output in the following format.\nThe first line contains a number p which is the minimum number of used colors.\nThe ith line in the next m lines contain n integers, in which the jth number is the color index of the light bulb in the corresponding place, or 0 if the place does not need a light bulb. The colors are numbered from 1 to p. Your program can print any correct solution.\nPrint a blank line after each test case's output.\nExample\nInput\n1\n\n4 4\n1001\n1101 \n1011\n1001\n\nOutput\n4\n1 0 0 2 \n2 1 0 3 \n3 0 1 4 \n4 0 0 1 \n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nShankar_IT150\n\n\nTester:\nfriggstad\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LIGHTING\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Shankar_IT150, april10, hard\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2410\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-03-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.47644 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
