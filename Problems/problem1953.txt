Find a way to assign a direction to each of its edges such that the resulting directed graph is egg-free, or determine that it is impossible. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.\nMM lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers uiui and vivi denoting an edge between vertices uiui and vivi.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nIf it is impossible to assign a direction to each edge in such a way that the resulting graph is egg-free, print a single line containing the string "No solution" (without quotes).\nOtherwise, print a single line containing a string with length MM. For each valid ii, the ii-th character of this string should be \'^\' if you want to direct the ii-th edge from uiui to vivi, or \'v\' if you want to direct it from vivi to uiui.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa451\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4200,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4200,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid ii\nui\xe2\x89\xa0viui\xe2\x89\xa0vi for each valid ii\neach pair of vertices is connected by at most one edge\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N,M\xe2\x89\xa420N,M\xe2\x89\xa420\nSubtask #2 (20 points): N,M\xe2\x89\xa4200N,M\xe2\x89\xa4200\nSubtask #3 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n7 6\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 6\n6 7\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n^^v\n^^^^^^\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85gainullinildar\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EGGFREE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Chordal Graphs, BFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2693\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-02-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
