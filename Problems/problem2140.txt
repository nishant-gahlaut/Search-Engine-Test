b'\n\n\nFor a given positive integer N find the number of all positive integers X such that N divides X and the number of all positive divisors of X (including 1 and X) is equal to N. If there exist infinitely many such numbers print -1.\n\nInput\n The first line contains a single positive integer T <= 100, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a positive integer N , where N <= 10^18.\n\nOutput\n For each test case, output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case.\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n6\n113\n144\n\nOutput:\n2\n1\n-1\n\nExplanation\nIn the first test case only numbers 12 and 18 have 6 divisors and are divisible by 6.\n\nIn the second test case the only number is 113^112.\n\nIn the third test case there are infinitely many of them.\n\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85anton_adm\n\n\nTester:\nfriggstad\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DIVNODIV\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Case work, Prime Divisors, Primes\n                 \n                     \n                     Special, Mathematics, Number Theory, Integer Factorisation, Divisors\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2869\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-01-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.361299 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
