b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nThis problem's statement is really a short one.\nYou are given an integer S. Consider an infinite sequence S, 2S, 3S, ... . Find the first number in this sequence that can be represented as Q3, where Q is some positive integer number. As the sought number could be very large, please print modulo (109 + 7).\nThe number S will be given to you as a product of N positive integer numbers A1, A2, ..., AN, namely S = A1 * A2 * ... * AN\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer N.\nThen there is a line, containing N space separated integers, denoting the numbers A1, A2, ..., AN.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the first term of the sequence which is the perfect cube, modulo 109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n(Subtask 1): N = 1, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 S \xe2\x89\xa4 109 - 15 points.\n(Subtask 2): N = 1, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 S \xe2\x89\xa4 1018 - 31 point.\n(Subtask 3): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 1018 - 54 points.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2\n2 2\n2\n2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8\n216\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. First few numbers in the infinite sequence 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, , etc. In this sequence, 8 is the first number which is also a cube (as 23 = 8).\nExample case 2. First few numbers in the infinite sequence 6, 12, 18, 24, , etc. In this sequence, 216 is the first number which is also a cube (as 63 = 216).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsergey_adm\n\n\nTester:\n4\xe2\x98\x85furko\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FCUBE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 GCD, Sieve of Eratosthenes, Prime Divisors\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Integer Factorisation, Divisors\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2642\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-01-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
