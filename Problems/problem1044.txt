b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nBear Limak is an assistant in the kitchen.\nWhile he doesn\'t really know how to cook, he can run very fast and thus Chef often sends him to buy new ingredients from shops.\nChef needs K different ingredients, numbered 1 through K.\nThe kitchen is located at the point (0, 0).\nThere are N shops.\nThe i-th shop is located at the point (Xi, Yi) and its inventory is described by the string si of length K.\nThe i-th character of si is \'1\' if the i-th ingredient is available in this shop, and \'0\' otherwise.\nAll N+1 points are distinct (the kitchen and the N shops).\nLimak must start from the kitchen, visit some shops and buy all necessary ingredients (each of K ingredients should be available in at least one visited shop), and go back to the kitchen.\nWhat is the minimum total distance Limak will cover?\nPrint -1 if it\'s impossible to get all the ingredients.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers N and K denoting the number of shops and the number of ingredients.\nThe i-th of the next N lines contains two integers xi and yi denoting coordinates of the i-th shop.\nNo two shops are at the same point, and no shop is at the point (0, 0).\nThe i-th of the next N lines contains a string si of length K, consisting of characters \'1\' and \'0\'.\nThe j-th character is \'1\' if and only if the j-th ingredient is available in this shop.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer: a number -1 if Limak can\'t get all K ingredients, or one real value otherwise \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum total distance.\nThe relative or absolute error shouldn\'t exceed 10-6.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 36\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4\xc2\xa012\n-1000 \xe2\x89\xa4 xi, yi \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n3 6\n100 100\n-50 100\n0 -100\n111110\n110011\n001111\n3 6\n100 100\n-50 100\n0 -100\n111110\n110011\n111111\n3 6\n100 100\n-50 100\n0 -210\n111110\n110011\n111111\n3 6\n100 100\n-50 100\n0 -210\n111010\n110011\n111011\n10 10\n763 77\n512 859\n494 362\n-986 -885\n-866 890\n128 553\n-879 981\n449 310\n-406 10\n-955 -475\n0000001000\n1000000000\n0000000100\n0001000000\n0000100000\n0010000000\n0000010000\n0000000001\n0100000000\n0000000010\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n403.2247551123\n200.0000000000\n403.2247551123\n-1\n6652.7837723893\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1. There are 3 shops, located at points (100, 100), (-50, 100) and (0, -100). The first shop is described by a string "111110", which means that ingredients 1 through 5 are available in this shop, but ingredient 6 isn\'t. The other two shops are described by strings "110011" and "001111" respectively. Any two shops are enough to get all 6 ingredients (because, for every two shops it\'s true that each of 6 ingredients is available in at least one of those two shops).\nTo minimize the total distance, Limak should visit the first and the second shop (in any order). For example, his journey can look as follows:\n\nGo from the starting point (0, 0) to the first shop (100, 100). The distance is sqrt(1002 + 1002) = 141.4213562373095.\nGo from (100, 100) to (-50, 100). The distance is 150.\nGo from (-50, 100) back to the kitchen at (0, 0). The distance is sqrt(502 + 1002) = 111.80339887498948\n\nThe total distance is 141.4213562373095 + 150 + 111.80339887498948 = 403.224755112299.\nTest case 2. This time the third shop has all the ingredients. It\'s optimal to visit only this shop and go back to the kitchen.\nTest case 4. Limak can\'t get all ingredients, even if he visits all the shops. The answer is -1.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85errichto\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85mnbvmar\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SHOPTRIP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DP Bitmask\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2399\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-04-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
