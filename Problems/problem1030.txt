b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\n\nDevu is learning Combinatorics in his college. He find it very interesting to calculate number of ways of going to point (c,d) from point (a,b) in co-ordinate plane. We can take horizontal and vertical steps only and can not visit at a point twice. In a step, you can move one unit only. We have to reach to the point (c,d) from the point (a,b) using abs(a-c)+ abs(b-d) steps only.\n\n \nDevu has two sets of points. Set A contains points having X co-ordinate 0 and Y co-ordinates varying from 1 to N(both inclusive). Set B contains points having X co-ordinate K and Y co-ordinates varying from 1 to N(both inclusive).  Both sets contains N number of integral points. He wants to calculate the sum of number of ways to going to the each point of set B from the each point of set A .\n\n\nAs the answer can be large, print it modulo 1000000007.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases.  \n Next T lines will contain pair of integers N and K\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single integer representing the answer of that test case.\n\nConstraints\n\nSubtask #1: 10 points\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T  \xe2\x89\xa4 20, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N ,K \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n\n\n\nSubtask #1: 10 points\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T  \xe2\x89\xa4 20, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N ,K \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n\n\n\nSubtask #3: 80 points\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T  \xe2\x89\xa4 10000, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N,K  \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2 2\n4 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8\n236\n\n\nExplanation\n\nFor the first sample case,\nways[(0,1)->(2,1)]= 1\nways[(0,2)->(2,2)]= 1\nways[(0,1)->(2,2)]= 3\nways[(0,2)->(2,1)]= 3\nSo, the total number of ways = 8.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85amitpandeykgp\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/NWAYS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Permutations & Combinations\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Combinatorics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2341\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-05-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
