b"\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nYou are given a sequence of integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. You may change any number of its elements (possibly zero), obtaining a new sequence of positive integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BNB1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN. Each element of BB must be an integer between 22 and 5050 (both inclusive).\nLet's define an undirected graph GG with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN). For each pair of different vertices ii and jj, there is an edge between ii and jj if and only if BiBi and BjBj are coprime.\nYou should choose the sequence BB in such a way that GG is a connected graph. The number of elements which need to be changed to obtain BB from AA should be minimum possible. Find one such sequence BB and the minimum required number of changes.\nIt can be proven that a solution always exists \xe2\x80\x94 it is always possible to modify sequence AA in such a way that GG is connected.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print two lines. The first line should contain a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum required number of changes. The second line should contain NN space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BNB1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN \xe2\x80\x94 the modified sequence.\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any one.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851041\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa450\n2\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4502\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa450 for each valid ii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\nExample Input\n2\n2\n2 3\n2\n2 4\n\nExample Output\n0\n2 3\n1\n2 3\n\nExplanation\nExample 1: There is an edge in GG between vertices 11 and 22. This graph is connected, so there is no need to change any elements.\nExample 2: There is no edge between vertices 11 and 22 since gcd(2,4)\xe2\x89\xa01gcd(2,4)\xe2\x89\xa01. This graph is not connected. We can change element A2=4A2=4 to 33 and make this graph connected.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin2\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ARRGRAPH\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Disjoint Set Union\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-10-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
