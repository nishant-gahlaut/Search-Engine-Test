b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef Thanos has an undirected simple graph with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN) and MM edges (numbered 11 through MM). For each valid ii, the ii-th edge connects vertices uiui and vivi. Chef Thanos wants to colour the edges in red and green so that the graph would be perfectly balanced, which means that for each vertex, the number of red edges incident to it must be equal to the number of green edges incident to it.\nObviously, Chef Thanos does not want to leave any edges colourless, but he immediately realised that in such a case, it generally may be impossible to make the graph perfectly balanced, so he decided to colour some of the edges yellow instead, so that it is always possible.\nSince Chef Thanos hates the colour yellow, his satisfaction with the graph will be greater when he uses fewer yellow edges. Can you help him choose how to colour the edges so that you remain in the surviving half of humanity?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.\nMM lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers uiui and vivi.\n\nOutput\nPrint MM lines. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines should contain the integer 00 if you want the ii-th edge to be yellow, 11 if you want it to be red or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if you want it to be green.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851050\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid ii\nthe graph does not contain any self-loops or parallel edges, but it can be disconnected\nthe sum of NN over all the test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of MM over all the test cases does not exceed 9\xe2\x8b\x851059\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nScoring\nIf your output is invalid or you do not colour the graph in a perfectly balanced way, you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict and 0 points. Otherwise:\n\nFor each test case, let's define R=Y/NR=Y/N, where YY is the number of yellow edges you used to colour a graph with NN vertices. We then take the maximum of RR across all test cases and denote it by RmaxRmax.\nIf Rmax\xe2\x89\xa53Rmax\xe2\x89\xa53, you will receive 0 points because you used too many yellow edges (but you will still receive the Accepted verdict).\nIf 2\xe2\x89\xa4Rmax<32\xe2\x89\xa4Rmax<3, you will receive 20 points.\nIf 1.5\xe2\x89\xa4Rmax<21.5\xe2\x89\xa4Rmax<2, you will receive 40 points.\nIf Rmax<1.5Rmax<1.5, you will receive 100 points.\n\nNote that you do not have to use the smallest number of yellow edges.\nExample Input\n2\n5 6\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n3 4\n4 5\n5 3\n6 9\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 3\n2 4\n3 4\n3 6\n4 5\n5 6\n\nExample Output\n-1\n1\n1\n-1\n1\n-1\n-1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n-1\n0\n0\n0\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The graph can be perfectly balanced without using any yellow edges.\n\nExample case 2: The first colouring in the figure below corresponds to the output. Note, again, that you do not have to completely minimise the number of yellow edges, so even though the second colouring is also perfectly balanced and uses fewer yellow edges, both of them would receive 100 points.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mohammed200218\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RGY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Link Cut Tree, Coloring, Cycles, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2826\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-08-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
