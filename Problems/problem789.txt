b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nMaheshmati and Sangu are playing a game. First, Maheshmati gives Sangu a sequence of N distinct integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN (not necessarily sorted) and an integer K. Sangu has to create all subsequences of this sequence with length K. For each subsequence, he has to write down the product of K\xe2\x88\x922 integers: all elements of this subsequence except the minimum and maximum element.\nSangu wins the game if he is able to write down all these numbers and tell Maheshmati their product (modulo 109+7, since it can be very large). However, Sangu is a very lazy child and thus wants you to help him win this game. Compute the number Sangu should tell Maheshmati!\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the product of all numbers written down by Sangu modulo 109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45,000\n3\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa410,000 for each valid i\nthe numbers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN are pairwise distinct\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4 3 \n1 2 3 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n36\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: There are four possible subsequences:\n\n[1,2,3] (Sangu should write down 2.)\n[1,3,4] (Sangu should write down 3.)\n[1,2,4] (Sangu should write down 2.)\n[2,3,4] (Sangu should write down 3.)\n\nThe required product is 2\xe2\x8b\x853\xe2\x8b\x852\xe2\x8b\x853=36.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85shubhscoder\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/NMNMX\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Modular Exponentiation, Fermat's Little Theorem, Combinatorics\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Modular Arithmetic\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1957\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-06-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
