b'\nWe call a non-negative number x good if its binary representation is palindromic. For example, 107 is good because its binary representation is 1101011 which is palindromic while 10 is not good because its binary representation is 1010 which is not palindromic.\nRecall that, a string is said to be palindromic if it reads the same backward as forward.\nYou are given a number n. You have to express n as a sum of at most 12 good numbers. If there exist multiple answers, print any one of them.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each testcase contains a single integer n.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each testcase, print a single integer m (1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa412), denoting the number of good numbers. In the next line, print a sequence of m good numbers whose sum is equal to n. If there are multiple such sequences, print any of them.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n24\n4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n21 3\n4\n1 1 1 1\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1:\n\n21 is good because 21=(10101)2 which is palindromic.\n3 is good because 3=(11)2 which is palindromic.\n\nTest case 2:\n\n1 is good because 1=(1)2 which is palindromic.\n\nHere ()2 denotes binary representation of the number.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85jeevanjyot\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PALSUM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bit Manipulation, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1991\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-11-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
