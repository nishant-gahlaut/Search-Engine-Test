b'\n\nGenjiko is one of the Japanese traditional games.\nChef Ciel will take place a variant version of genjiko in her restaurant.\n\n\nThe rules of the game are the following:\n\n\nThe challenger must be blindfolded.\nCiel feeds the challenger one of the N foods menus of her restaurant, M times.\nThe challenger must answer whether the i-th food and the j-th food are same or not, for all 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i < j \xe2\x89\xa4 M.\nFor making the game difficult, Ciel cannot use the same menu for both the i-th menu and the (i+j)-th menu for all 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 j \xe2\x89\xa4 K. (The challenger knows this)\n\n\nCiel wonders how many patterns can be the challenger\'s answer.\nYour task is calculating the number of the patterns modulo 1000000009 (109+9).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.\nThen T test cases follow.\nEach test case has 3 integers N, M and K.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the number of the patterns of the possible answers modulo 1000000009 (109+9).\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 200\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000000 (109)\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 200\n\nSample Input\n5\n200 5 0\n2 3 1\n2 3 0\n3 3 1\n1 1000000000 200\nSample Output\n52\n1\n4\n2\n0\nOutput details\n\nThe first case is the same as genjiko.\nIn the traditional game genjiko, we make connections between each possible answer and the name of a book of The Tale of Genji.\nHowever The Tale of Genji is composed of 54 books, so the names of the first book and the last book are unused.\n\n\nLet the letters A, B, C, ... denote the N menus, and let "ABA" mean that Ciel uses A for the 1st food, and uses B for the 2nd food, and uses A for the 3rd food.\nIn the second case, Ciel cannot use the same menu consecutively.\nSo Ciel can use only 2 patterns "ABA" and "BAB".\nHowever there is only one possible answer [1st \xe2\x89\xa0 2nd, 1st = 3rd, 2nd \xe2\x89\xa0 3rd].\n\n\nIn the third case, Ciel can use 8 patterns "AAA", "AAB", "ABA", "ABB", "BAA", "BAB", "BBA" and "BBB".\nAnd there are four possible answers [1st = 2nd, 1st = 3rd, 2nd = 3rd], [1st = 2nd, 1st \xe2\x89\xa0 3rd, 2nd \xe2\x89\xa0 3rd], [1st \xe2\x89\xa0 2nd, 1st = 3rd, 2nd \xe2\x89\xa0 3rd] and [1st \xe2\x89\xa0 2nd, 1st \xe2\x89\xa0 3rd, 2nd \xe2\x89\xa0 3rd].\n\n\nIn the fifth case, Ciel can use no patterns.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nhiroto_adm\n\n\nTester:\n4\xe2\x98\x85rajivka\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CIELGAME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cook20, hiroto_adm, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2687\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-02-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.160883 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
