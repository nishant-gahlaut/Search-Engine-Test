b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nAll bandits are afraid of Sheriff. Sheriff constantly fights crime, but when bandits lay low, he gets bored and starts to entertain himself. \nThis time Sheriff gathered all the bandits in his garden and ordered them to line up. After the whistle all bandits should change the order in which they stand. \nSheriff gave all the bandits numbers from 1 to N. For each place i he determined the unique position j. After whistling the bandit  staying on position i should run to the j-th position. Sheriff loved seeing how the bandits move around, and he continued whistling until the evening. He finished the game only when he noticed that the bandits are in the same order in which they were standing originally.\nNow the Sheriff asks the question: How many times has he whistled?\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of bandits. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting that the bandit staying on position i should run to the Ai-th position after the whistle.\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing number of times the sheriff had to whistle, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\nAll Ai are distinct numbers from 1 to N\n\xc2\xa0\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n1 2 3\n5\n2 3 1 5 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n6\n\n\nExplanation\n \nExample case 2.\nthe bandits positions are:\n0. 1 2 3 4 5\n1. 3 1 2 5 4\n2. 2 3 1 4 5\n3. 1 2 3 5 4\n4. 3 1 2 4 5\n5. 2 3 1 5 4\n6. 1 2 3 4 5.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nberezin\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SGARDEN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 LCM\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1811\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-01-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
