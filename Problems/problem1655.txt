b'\nYogesh has built a new hospital, with N(2<= N <= 100,000) beds. The beds are located along a straight line at positions x1,\xe2\x80\xa6,xN (0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000).  \nTheir are C(2<= C <=N) number of COVID infected persons. To prevent the further infections, you have to assign the beds to infected persons in such a way that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible.\nWhat is the largest minimum distance?  \nConstraints\n(2 <= N <= 100,000)   \n(0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000)  \n(2 <= C <= N)   \nInput\nt \xe2\x80\x93 the number of test cases, then t test cases follows.  \n\nLine 1: Two space-separated integers: N and C  \nLine 2: N space seperated integers representing the bed locations i.e xi  \n\nOutput\nFor each test case output one integer: the largest minimum distance.\nSample Testcase 1:\nInput\n1\n5 3\n1 2 8 4 9  \nOutput:\n3  \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85avishake_maji\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/INFECT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 avishake_maji, binary-search, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-02-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
