Isaac told Chef that his team needs to solve the following problem to win ACPC and qualify to ICPC 2021. However, no one in the team is good at expected value problems \xe2\x80\x95 can you help them qualify?\nA sequence a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aNa1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN is said to be a hill sequence if there is an integer pp (1\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x89\xa4N) such that 0\xe2\x89\xa4a1\xe2\x89\xa4a2\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x89\xa4ap\xe2\x89\xa5ap+1\xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x89\xa5aN\xe2\x89\xa50. For example, the sequences [1,2,2,3], [1,2,5,5,2,0] and [5,4,3,3] are hill sequences, but [1,2,2,1,3] is not.\nConsider all hill sequences a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN such that \xe2\x88\x91Ni=1ai=M. We choose one of them uniformly randomly. Then, we define F(a,K)=\xe2\x88\x91Ni=1aKi. For the purposes of this problem, 00=1. What is the expected value of F(a,K) modulo 109+7?\nThe answer can be expressed as a fraction pq, where p and q are non-negative integers and q is coprime with 109+7 for the given constraints. You should compute p\xe2\x8b\x85q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 109+7, where q\xe2\x88\x921 denotes the multiplicative inverse of q modulo 109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and K.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer p\xe2\x8b\x85q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa420\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4 1 2\n4 2 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n10\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: There are four hill sequences we can choose: [1,0,0,0], [0,1,0,0], [0,0,1,0] and [0,0,0,1]. For each of them, F(a,1)=1, so the expected value is 1.\nExample case 2: There are 7 hill sequences we can choose:\n\n[2,0,0,0], [0,2,0,0], [0,0,2,0] and [0,0,0,2], each with F(a,2)=16\n[1,1,0,0], [0,1,1,0] and [0,0,1,1], each with F(a,2)=2\n\nThe expected value is 4\xe2\x8b\x8516+3\xe2\x8b\x8527=10.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85isaacmoris\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/HILLARR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Expected Value, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Probability, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3185\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-03-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
