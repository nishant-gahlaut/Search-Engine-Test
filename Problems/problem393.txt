b'\nChef has a new customer and he wants to prepare his order as soon as possible. While preparing, he sees that the mint sauce is finished. He has to run upstairs to get it from other kitchen. Chef is currently on the XthXth stair. He has to climb all the way up to the YthYth stair in minimum number of steps. In one step, Chef can do one of the following things: \n\nClimb a single stair. ( i.e go from the XthXth stair to the (X+1)th(X+1)th stair. ) \nClimb two stairs only if the final stair falls at a prime number position. ( i.e. go from the XthXth stair to the (X+2)th(X+2)th stair, only if (X+2(X+2) is a prime number) \n\nHelp Chef reach the YthYth stair from the XthXth stair in minimum number of steps. \nSee Explanation for more clarity.See Explanation for more clarity.\nNote: The input files are large. The use of Fast I/O is recommended.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains an integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The TT test cases then follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains XX and YY denoting the starting stair and ending stair respectively.\n\nOutput Format\n\nOutput a single integer representing minimum number of steps chef can take to reach from XthXth to YthYth stair.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X<Y\xe2\x89\xa41071\xe2\x89\xa4X<Y\xe2\x89\xa4107\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n2 10\n5 12\n34 43\n57 63\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n6\n5\n6\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: Chef starts from 2nd2nd, goes to 3rd3rd stair, then to 5th5th stair as 55 or (3+2)(3+2) is prime number. Now, from 5th5th stair, Chef goes to 7th7th stair as 77 or (5+2)(5+2) is a prime number, then Chef goes to 8th8th stair, then to 9th9th stair and finally to 10th10th stair. This approach takes a total of 66 steps which is the minimum possible number of steps Chef can take to reach the 10th10th stair starting from the 2nd2nd stair. \nTest case 33: Starting from the 34th34th stair, Chef moves through the stairs as following. 3434 \xe2\x86\x92 3535 \xe2\x86\x92 3737 \xe2\x86\x92 3838 \xe2\x86\x92 3939 \xe2\x86\x92 4141 \xe2\x86\x92 4343.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85shivyyy_21\n\n\nTester:\n5\xe2\x98\x85mexomerf\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFMGX\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sieve of Eratosthenes, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2004\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-09-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
