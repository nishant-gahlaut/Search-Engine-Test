The prices of petrol and diesel per unit volume are PpPp and Pd respectively. Using one unit volume of fuel, you can travel one unit distance. The petrol tank of your car has a capacity Cp units. (It means that at any instant, your car can store no more than Cp volume of petrol. The diesel tank of your car has a capacity Cd.\nThere are N cities and M uni-directional roads in your country. You know the endpoints and lengths of all the roads. The cities are of four types:\n\nType 0 :No fuel is available in this city.\nType 1 : Only petrol is available in this city. When you are in this city, you can refill your petrol tank to any volume \xe2\x89\xa4Cp, paying Pp per unit volume of added petrol.\nType 2 : Only diesel  is available in this city. When you are in this city, you can refill your diesel tank to any volume \xe2\x89\xa4Cd, paying Pd per unit volume of added diesel.\nType 3 : Both petrol and diesel are available in this city. When in this city, you can refill either petrol or diesel or both respecting the respective capacity constraints and paying Pp per unit volume of added petrol and Pd per unit of added diesel.\n\nCurrently, you are in city 1 with no fuel in your car and want to travel to city N. Find the minimum possible cost of the fuel you will have to buy.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nThe first line of each testcase contains two integers, N and M.\nThe second line contains two integers, Cp and Cd.\nThe third line contains two integers Pp and Pd.\nThe fourth line contains the space separated types of the N cities.\nEach of the next M lines contains the description of a road : u,v,l, meaning that there is uni-directional road from city u to city v of length l.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, if it is impossible to travel from city 1 to city N, print \xe2\x88\x921 on a new line. Else, print the minimum possible cost on a new line.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4300.\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4N(N\xe2\x88\x921).\nThe sum of N over all testcases doesn't exceed 300.\nThere is no road from a city to itself, and for any ordered pair (u,v) there is at max one road from u to v.\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Cp,Cd\xe2\x89\xa4300.\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pp,Pd\xe2\x89\xa42000.\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N and u\xe2\x89\xa0v.\n1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4500.\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4n,Cp,Cd\xe2\x89\xa430.\nSubtask #2 (30 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4n,Cp,Cd\xe2\x89\xa480.\nSubtask #3 (20 points): Type of each city is either 0 or 3.\nSubtask #4 (40 points): original constraints.\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n    4 4\n    4 4\n    10 5\n    3 1 2 0\n    1 2 7\n    2 4 3\n    2 3 1\n    3 4 3\n    2 1\n    4 4\n    10 5\n    3 1\n    1 2 9\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n75\n    -1\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the first testcase, the following plan is optimal:\n\nIn city 1, buy 4 units of diesel and 4 units of petrol with total cost 4\xc3\x9710+4\xc3\x975=60. Now you have 8 units of fuel, so you can reach city 3 (1\xe2\x86\x922\xe2\x86\x923). \nIn city 3, buy 3 units of diesel, which is enough to reach city 4. The cost here is 3\xc3\x975=15.\n\nThe total cost is 60+15=75.\nIn the second testcase, the maximum fuel you can get is 8 units, but the only road from city 1 to city 2 has length 9. So, there is no possible way.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85jtnydv25\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CARPD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sets, Floyd Warshall's Algorithm, Dijkstra's Algorithm\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Shortest Paths\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
