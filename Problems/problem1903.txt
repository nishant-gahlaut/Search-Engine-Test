b'\n\nGiven N integers A1, A2, \xe2\x80\xa6. AN, Dexter wants to know how many ways he can choose three numbers such that they are  three consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression. \n\n\nMeaning that, how many triplets (i, j, k) are there such that  1  \xe2\x89\xa4 i < j < k \xe2\x89\xa4 N and Aj - Ai = Ak - Aj.\n\n\nSo the triplets (2, 5, 8), (10, 8, 6), (3, 3, 3) are valid as they are three consecutive terms of an arithmetic \nprogression. But the triplets (2, 5, 7), (10, 6, 8) are not.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of the input contains an integer N (3 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100000). Then the following line contains N space separated integers A1, A2, \xe2\x80\xa6, AN and they have values between 1 and 30000 (inclusive).\n\nOutput\n\nOutput the number of ways to choose a triplet such that they are three consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression.\n\nExample\nInput:\n10\n3 5 3 6 3 4 10 4 5 2\n\nOutput:\n9\n\n\nExplanation\nThe followings are all 9 ways to choose a triplet\n\n1 : (i, j, k) = (1, 3, 5), (Ai, Aj, Ak) = (3, 3, 3)\n2 : (i, j, k) = (1, 6, 9), (Ai, Aj, Ak) = (3, 4, 5)\n3 : (i, j, k) = (1, 8, 9), (Ai, Aj, Ak) = (3, 4, 5)\n4 : (i, j, k) = (3, 6, 9), (Ai, Aj, Ak) = (3, 4, 5)\n5 : (i, j, k) = (3, 8, 9), (Ai, Aj, Ak) = (3, 4, 5)\n6 : (i, j, k) = (4, 6, 10), (Ai, Aj, Ak) = (6, 4, 2)\n7 : (i, j, k) = (4, 8, 10), (Ai, Aj, Ak) = (6, 4, 2)\n8 : (i, j, k) = (5, 6, 9), (Ai, Aj, Ak) = (3, 4, 5)\n9 : (i, j, k) = (5, 8, 9), (Ai, Aj, Ak) = (3, 4, 5)\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nimran_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85laycurse\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COUNTARI\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 FFT, DP Approach\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Transformations, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2587\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-10-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nJAVA, C, CPP14, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PAS fpc, NODEJS, GO, HASK, PERL, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, LISP clisp, ERL, CLPS, ICK, NICE, ICON, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
