b"\n\nLet X be the set of all integers between 0 and n-1. Suppose we have a collection S1, S2, ..., Sm of subsets of X. Say an atom A is a subset of X such that for each Si we have either A is a subset of Si or A and Si do not have any common elements.\n\n\n\nYour task is to find a collection A1, ..., Ak of atoms such that every item in X is in some Ai and no two Ai, Aj with i \xe2\x89\xa0 j share a common item. Surely such a collection exists as we could create a single set {x} for each x in X. A more interesting question is to minimize k, the number of atoms.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single positive integer t \xe2\x89\xa4 30 indicating the number of test cases. Each test case begins with two integers n,m where n is the size of X and m is the number of sets Si. Then m lines follow where the i'th such line begins with an integer vi between 1 and n (inclusive) indicating the size of Si. Following this are vi distinct integers between 0 and n-1 that describe the contents of Si.\n\n\n\nYou are guaranteed that 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 100 and 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 m \xe2\x89\xa4 \n30. Furthermore, each number between 0 and n-1 will appear in at least one set Si.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case you are to output a single integer indicating the minimum number of atoms that X can be partitioned into to satisfy the constraints.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5 2\n3 0 1 2\n3 2 3 4\n4 3\n2 0 1\n2 1 2\n2 2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nzac_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85pieguy\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ATOMS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Graphs, Disjoint Set Union, Connected Components, Set Theory, Bitmasking, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos, Mathematics, Bit Manipulation, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1762\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-01-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.04632 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
