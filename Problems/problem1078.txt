b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarian Chinise.\nLet A be a set of the first N positive integers :A={1,2,3,4.........N} Let B be the set containing all the subsets of A. \nLet A be a set of the first N positive integers :A={1,2,3,4.........N} Let B be the set containing all the subsets of A. \nProfessor Eric is a mathematician who defined two kind of relations R1 and R2 on set B. The relations are defined as follows: R1={ (x,y) : x and y belong to B and x is not a subset of y and y is not a subset of x and the intersection of x and y is equal to empty set } R2={ (x,y) : x and y belong to B and x is not a subset of y and y is not a subset of x and the intersection of x and y is not equal to empty set } \nNow given the number N,Professor Eric wants to know how many relations of kind R1 and R2 exists.Help him. NOTE : (x,y) is the same as (y,x) ,i.e the pairs are unordered.\nInput format:\nThe first line contains the number of test cases T.Each of the test case is denoted by a single integer N.\nOutput format:\nOutput T lines, one for each test case,containing two integers denoting the number of relations of kind R1 and R2 respectively, modulo 100000007.\nConstraints:\n1 <= T <= 1000\n1 <= N <= 10^18\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1\n2\n3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0 0\n1 0\n6 3\n\n\nExplanation\nLet A={1,2}\nThen B={Phi,{1},{2},{1,2}}\nPhi=Empty Set\nSo R1=Either {({1},{2})} or {({2},{1})}\nand R2=No relation exists\nSo,there is 1 relation of kind R1 and 0 relation of kind R2.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsnigdha_adm\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85subra\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COUNTREL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Set Theory, Exponentiation, Modulo Multiplicative Inverse, Combinatorics\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Modular Arithmetic\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1609\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-12-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.166667 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nJAVA, C, CPP14, PYP3, CS2, PAS fpc, NODEJS, GO, PAS gpc, D\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
