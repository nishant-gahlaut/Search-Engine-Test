b'\nA group of 5 logicians are playing a game of Clue (also known as Cluedo).  The game is played with 18 cards:\n6 "suspect" cards, 6 "weapon" cards, and 6 "room" cards (the original game has 9 room cards, but the logicians\nhave removed 3 in order for everyone to receive the same number of cards).  At the beginning of the game, 1 of each type of\ncard is chosen at random and placed in an envelope, whose contents are kept secret.  The remaining cards are\nthen dealt out randomly to the players, 3 cards each.  The goal of the game is\nto be the first player to determine which cards are in the envelope.  To make things more interesting, the\nlogicians have modified the rules to the game as follows:\nFirst of all, the cards are each given a unique number: The "suspect" cards are given numbers 1-6, the \n"weapon" cards numbers 7-12, and the "room" cards 13-18.  At the start of play, each logician announces\nthe sum of his cards to the group.  Then, starting with the first logician and continuing in a circle, each logician\nwill either pass, or declare himself the winner by announcing the contents of the secret envelope.  After the fifth\nlogician\'s turn, it becomes the first logician\'s turn again.  The\nlogicians are very smart, and will never pass if it\'s possible for them to deduce the contents of the\nenvelope, nor will they ever attempt to guess the contents of the envelope when they don\'t know with certainty.\nFurthermore, all of the logicians are aware of the fact that none of them will pass if it\'s\npossible to win.\nYour task is to determine, given the distribution of the cards, which logician will win (if any).\nInput:\nInput begins with an integer T (about 100), the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of 5 lines of 3 integers each, indicating the cards held by each of the\n5 logicians.  Each integer will be between 1 and 18, inclusive, and exactly one integer from each\nof the ranges 1-6, 7-12, and 13-18 will be absent from each test case.  The first line corresponds\nto the logician whose turn is first, the second line to the logician whose turn is second,\nand so on.  Each test case is separated by a blank line\nOutput:\nFor each test case output a single integer, on a line by itself, indicating the (1-based) index of the\nlogician who wins the game, or -1 if the game has no winner (i.e. continues forever).\nSample Input:\n2\n\n6 10 16\n3 2 11\n8 9 12\n15 17 18\n4 5 14\n\n1 4 5\n7 10 11\n3 6 9\n12 14 15\n16 17 18\nSample Output:\n1\n2\nExplanation:\nIn the first example, the cards in the envelope are 1, 7, and 13.  All of the logicians immediately know this,\nhowever the first logician wins because it must be one\'s turn in order to win.\nIn the second example, the cards in the envelope are 2, 8, and 13.  Note that initially the second player does not\nhave enough information to determine which cards are in the envelope.  However, the fact\nthat the first player passes is enough for the second player deduce the first player\'s cards (if the first player\nhad been holding 2 3 5, for example, he would have won instead of pass), which in turn allows him to \ndetermine the secret cards and win.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndavid_adm\n\n\nTester:\n4\xe2\x98\x85anshuman_singh\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CLUE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 david_adm, hard, oct10\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2442\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-06-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.216667 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
