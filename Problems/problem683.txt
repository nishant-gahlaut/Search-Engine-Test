b'\nAujasvit just came up with a new game to play with his friends. NN people stand in a circle, each assigned an index from 1 to N in clockwise order. Then the following operation is done N\xe2\x88\x921 times.\n\nThe person with the lowest index holds a coin.\nThen, the coin then moves to the next person clockwise M\xe2\x88\x921 times.\nThen, the person who is holding the coin is removed from the circle.\n\nThe last person remaining after N\xe2\x88\x921 operations is the winner.\nAujasvit has already decided on the integer M to be used in the game. Before inviting people to play his game, Aujasvit wants to know the winner if the game has 1 player, 2 players, 3 players, \xe2\x80\xa6, X players. That is, you need to output the winner when N=1,N=2,...,N=X.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of each input contains T - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.\nThe only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers M and X.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each testcase, output X integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AX, where Ai is the index of the winner if i people are playing this game.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa410000\nSum of X over all testcases is not more than 5\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 1 1\n\n\nExplanation\n\nTest case 1:\nWhen there is only 1 player, they are the winner. Therefore player 1 wins.\nWhen there are 2 players, player 2 is removed in the first round. Therefore player 1 wins.\nWhen there are 3 players, player 2 is removed in the first round, and player 3 is removed in the second round. Therefore player 1 wins.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85vishesh_s\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CIRCLEGAME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, easy, exun2021, modular-arithmetic, vishesh_s\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1927\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-01-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
