b'\nSelina is Jon\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend.  They had planned to go for a date this evening, but Jon is stuck with a problem at work.\nHe has a string SS of length NN, containing all lower case alphabets. The string contains a odd occurring character (characters that is present odd times). The task is to find the character (if not present print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921). Jon is already late for his date, so help him solve this as quickly as possible.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, one string SS.\n\nOutput Format\n\nPrint the character.\nIf no such character is present, print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\nabcbacc\nabcba\nabccba\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nc\nc\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nCase 1: cc is occurred 33 times i.e odd number of times.\nCase 2: cc is occurring only 11 time.\nCase 3: no odd occurring character is present, printed \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85sayan_kashyapi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SELINA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 bitwise-xor, cakewalk, easy, frequency-array, sayan_kashyapi\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n6-08-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, PYPY, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, kotlin, PERL, JS, rust, R, swift, SQL, PERL6, PRLG, SQLQ, ST\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
