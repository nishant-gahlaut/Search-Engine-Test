b'\n\nThe Gray code (see wikipedia for more details) is a well-known concept.\nOne of its important properties is that every two adjacent numbers have exactly one different digit in their binary representation.\n\n\nIn this problem, we will give you n non-negative integers in a sequence A[1..n] (0<=A[i]<2^64), such that every two adjacent integers have exactly one different digit in their binary representation, similar to the Gray code.\n\n\nYour task is to check whether there exist 4 numbers A[i1], A[i2], A[i3], A[i4] (1 <= i1 < i2 < i3 < i4 <= n) out of the given n numbers such that A[i1] xor A[i2] xor A[i3] xor A[i4] = 0. Here xor is a bitwise operation which is same as ^ in C, C++, Java and xor in Pascal.\n\nInput\nFirst line contains one integer n (4<=n<=100000).\nSecond line contains n space seperated non-negative integers denoting the sequence A.\nOutput\nOutput \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d (quotes exclusive) if there exist four distinct indices i1, i2, i3, i4 such that A[i1] xor A[i2] xor A[i3] xor A[i4] = 0. Otherwise, output "No" (quotes exclusive) please.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n1 0 2 3 7\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\njingbo_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85laycurse\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GRAYSC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sets, Case work, Pigeonhole Principle, Brute Force\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Special, Mathematics, Set Theory, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1910\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-05-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.1 - 0.107125 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
