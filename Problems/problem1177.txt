In the store, they offer NN cans of coke (numbered 11 through NN). For each valid ii, the current temperature of the ii-th can is CiCi and its price is PiPi.\nAfter buying a can of coke, Chef wants to immediately start walking home; when he arrives, he wants to immediately drink the whole can. It takes Chef MM minutes to get home from the store. However, Chef does not know the value of MM yet.\nThe ambient temperature outside is KK. When a can of coke is outside, its temperature approaches the ambient temperature. Specifically, if its temperature is tt at some point in time:\n\nif t>K+1t>K+1, then one minute later, its temperature will be t\xe2\x88\x921t\xe2\x88\x921\nif t<K\xe2\x88\x921t<K\xe2\x88\x921, then one minute later, its temperature will be t+1t+1\nif K\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4K+1K\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4K+1, then one minute later, its temperature will be KK\n\nWhen Chef drinks coke from a can, he wants its temperature to be between LL and RR (inclusive). For each ii between 11 and QQ inclusive, find the cheapest can for which this condition is satisfied when M=iM=i or determine that there is no such can.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains five space-separated integers NN, QQ, KK, LL and RR.\nNN lines follow. For each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers CiCi and PiPi.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing QQ space-seperated integers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these integers should be the answer for M=iM=i: the price of the can Chef should buy, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to buy a can such that Chef's condition is satisfied.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n|Ci|\xe2\x89\xa4105|Ci|\xe2\x89\xa4105 for each valid ii\n|K|\xe2\x89\xa4105|K|\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\xe2\x88\x92105\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4105\xe2\x88\x92105\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 106106\nthe sum of QQ over all test cases does not exceed 106106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n\nN,Q\xe2\x89\xa41,000N,Q\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n|Ci|\xe2\x89\xa4103|Ci|\xe2\x89\xa4103 for each valid ii\n|K|\xe2\x89\xa4103|K|\xe2\x89\xa4103\n\xe2\x88\x92103\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4103\xe2\x88\x92103\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4103\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 10,00010,000\nthe sum of QQ over all test cases does not exceed 10,00010,000\n\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 2 5 4 6\n1 6\n2 8\n8 10\n3 5 10 20 30\n21 20\n22 22\n23 23\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n-1 8\n20 22 23 -1 -1\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COKE2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Priority Queue, Multiset, Lazy Propagation, Sorting, Binary Search, Range Minimum Queries\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Queues, Sets, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Segment Trees, Algorithms, Searching, Queries\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2450\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-08-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
