Knowing that Chef doesn\'t like palindromes, Fehc wants the longest palindromic substring to be as short as possible. The string should only contain the first A latin letters(e.g. let A=2, then this string only contains \'a\' and \'b\'). Please help Fehc and find such a string. If multiple solution exists, you can print any.\n\n\tInput\nThe first line of input is an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.\nT tests follow. For each test, there is a line containing two space-separated integers N and A.\n\n\tOutput\n\n\tFor each test, print a number L and a string s, separated by one space. L is equal to the length of longest palindromic substring of s, and s is the string that Fehc will give to Chef. You must minimize L, but in the case of multiple s\'s, any valid s is OK.\n\n\tConstraints\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A\xe2\x89\xa426\n(sum of N in all test cases)\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\n\tSubtask #1 (21 points):\nN\xe2\x89\xa410.\n\n\tSubtask #2 (79 points):\noriginal constraints.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n5 2\n12 26\n8 26\n7 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3 aaabb\n1 hapybirthday\n1 codechef\n3 aaababb\n\n\nExplanation\n\nExample case 1. There are multiple solutions. For example, "abaaa" is also correct. Note that "abbaa" is not a correct solution, since "abba" is a palindromic substring of length 4, which is not optimal.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85r_64\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFHPAL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, Observation, Brute Force\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1804\n\n\nDate Added:\n6-09-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
