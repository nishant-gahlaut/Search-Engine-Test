b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef defines a non-decreasing matrix as a matrix that satisfies the following rules:\nFor each row of the matrix, the elements of this row form a non-decreasing sequence.\nFor each column of the matrix, the elements of this column form a non-decreasing sequence.\nChef has a matrix A with size N \xc3\x97 M. Each element of this matrix is either unknown (denoted by -1) or a positive integer.\nChef would like to replace each unknown element of this matrix by a positive integer in such a way that the resulting matrix is non-decreasing. Find one possible resulting matrix or determine that it's impossible.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nN lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains M space-separated integers Ai1, Ai2, ..., AiM denoting the elements of the i-th row of matrix A.\nOutput\nFor each test case, if there is no way to obtain a non-decreasing matrix, print a single line containing the integer -1.\nOtherwise, print N lines describing the matrix obtained by replacing all unknown elements.\nFor each valid i, the i-th of these lines should contain M space-separated integers denoting the elements of the i-th row of this matrix. Each of these elements should lie between 1 and 2,000,000,000 inclusive.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Aij \xe2\x89\xa4 109 or Aij = -1 for each valid i, j\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4 4\n1 2 2 3\n1 -1 7 -1\n6 -1 -1 -1\n-1 -1 -1 -1\n2 3\n1 4 -1\n1 -1 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 2 2 3\n1 7 7 100\n6 10 20 101\n7 11 21 20000\n-1\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kefaa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CO92MATR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 2D Arrays, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1763\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-03-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
