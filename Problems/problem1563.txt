b'\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are NN cells (numbered 1 through N). Initially, each cell contains a single Chef.\nYou are given Q pairs of cell ranges [L1,R1],[L2,R2],\xe2\x80\xa6,[LQ,RQ]. Consider a sequence of integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN, where 1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i. For each k from 1 to Q, the following process is performed:\n\nFor each i (Lk\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4Rk), the Chef from cell i moves to cell ai. All Chefs move at the same time.\nWe check if each cell contains exactly one Chef afterwards. If there is a cell which does not contain exactly one Chef, the sequence a is invalid and we stop.\n\nYou should find a sequence a which is not invalid. (Note that for such a sequence, each cell contains exactly one Chef at any point.) In addition, you are given an integer p with the following meaning:\n\nIf p=0, you should find the lexicographically smallest sequence a.\nIf p=1, you should find the lexicographically largest sequence a.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers T and p, where T denotes the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.\nQ lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Li and Ri.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN.\n\nIf p=0, the sequence a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN should be the lexicographically smallest valid sequence.\nIf p=1, the sequence a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN should be the lexicographically largest valid sequence.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n0\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x89\xa41\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Li\xe2\x89\xa4Ri\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (15 points): p=0\nSubtask #2 (35 points):\n\np=1\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 103\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 103\n\nSubtask #3 (50 points): p=1\nExample Input 1\n2 0\n7 3\n2 5\n7 7\n3 4\n1 2\n1 1\n1 1\n\nExample Output 1\n1 2 3 4 5 1 7 \n1\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Whenever a Chef should move from some cell i, we have ai=i, so the Chefs do not move. That means the sequence [1,2,3,4,5,1,7] is valid and it can be proved that it is lexicographically smallest, too.\nExample Input 2\n2 1\n7 3\n2 5\n7 7\n3 4\n1 2\n1 1\n1 1\n\nExample Output 2\n7 5 4 3 2 7 7 \n1\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The Chefs move like this:\n\nfirst, 2\xe2\x86\x925,3\xe2\x86\x924,4\xe2\x86\x923,5\xe2\x86\x922; then, there is still exactly one Chef in each cell\nnext, Chef 7 stays in his cell\nfinally, the Chefs in cells 3 and 4 swap places\n\nThere is no point when there are two Chefs in a single cell at the same time, so the sequence [7,5,4,3,2,7,7] is valid and it can be proved that it is lexicographically largest, too.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nshishyando\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SOLDIERS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Difference Arrays, Hashing\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2883\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-02-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
