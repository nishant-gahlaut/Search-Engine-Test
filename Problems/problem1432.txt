He claims that this decomposition solves many difficult problems related to trees. However, he doesn\'t know how to find it quickly, so he asks you to help him.\nYou are given a tree with NN vertices numbered 1 through N. Let\'s denote an edge between vertices u and v by (u,v). The triple-tree decomposition is a partition of edges of the tree into unordered triples of edges (a,b),(a,c),(a,d) such that a\xe2\x89\xa0b\xe2\x89\xa0c\xe2\x89\xa0d. Each edge must belong to exactly one triple.\nHelp Kefaa with this problem \xe2\x80\x94 find a triple-tree decomposition of the given tree or determine that no such decomposition exists.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nEach of the following N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v describing an edge between vertices u and v of the tree.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a line containing the string "YES" if a triple-tree decomposition of the given tree exists or "NO" otherwise.\nIf it exists, print N\xe2\x88\x9213 more lines describing a decomposition.\nEach of these lines should contain four space-separated integers a, b, c and d describing a triple of edges (a,b),(a,c),(a,d).\n\nIf more than one triple-tree decomposition exists, you may output any one.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): 2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410\nSubtask #2 (30 points):\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45000 and the sum of N overall testcases doesn\'t exceed 5000\nSubtask #3 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n7\n1 2\n2 3\n1 4\n4 5\n1 6\n6 7\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\n1 2 3 4\nNO\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85altruist_\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TREE3\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DFS, BFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2387\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-04-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
