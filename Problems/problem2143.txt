b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n\nChef likes stereometry a lot. Recently he learned about polyhedrons. During his assignments, he found a problem which he couldn't solve. Can you please help him in solving the problem?\n\n\nYou are given a convex polyhedron. Each face of polyhedron is a regular polygon. All polyhedral angles are equal. You have to find number of different ways to paint all the faces of the polyhedron in one of the C colors. Note that two painting of the polyhedron are said to be same, if one can be reached from other by a sequence of rotations or mirror reflections of the polyhedron. As this value could be large, output it by modulo 109+7.\n\nInput\nThere is a single test case.\nFirst line of the input contains two positive integers - N (number faces of the polyhedron) and C (number of possible colors) \nNext N lines contain information about the faces of polyhedron: \nFirst number of each line contains an integer ki denoting number of faces adjacent to i-th face. Next ki integers in the same line denote the faces adjacent to i-th face. \nOutput\nOutput a single integer in a line denoting number of ways to color polyhedron in different ways modulo 109+7\n\nConstraints\n\n4 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 25\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 C \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1: Polyhedron is regular. Points - 20\nSubtask 2: Original constraints. Points - 80\n\nExample\nInput:\n6 2\n4 2 3 4 5\n4 1 3 5 6\n4 1 2 4 6\n4 1 3 5 6\n4 1 2 4 6\n4 2 3 4 5\n\nOutput:\n10\n\n\nInput:\n4 4\n3 2 3 4\n3 1 3 4\n3 1 2 4\n3 1 2 3\n\nOutput:\n35\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85mugurelionut\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFPOL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 burnside-lemma, hard, july16, mgch\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3025\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-06-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
