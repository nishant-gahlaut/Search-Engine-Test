b"\nRead problem statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a binary string S of length N, where the first K characters of S are '1', while the rest are '0'. He wants to make all the characters equal to '0'. You are allowed to perform the following operation on the string S as long as 2i\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4N:\n\nIn the ith operation, you can select any contiguous range of 2i\xe2\x88\x921 indices of S and flip their values.\n\nHe can use the above operation any number of times. If there is no sequence of operations that can convert the string to all '0's, print NO. \nOtherwise, print YES in the first line and then describe the operations. Print the starting indices of the contiguous range to be flipped in each operation. See Output Format for further details. \nInput Format\n\nFirst line of the input will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case contains a single line of input, two integers N,K.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, do the following:\n\nIf there is no sequence of operations to convert each character of S to '0', print NO.\nOtherwise, print YES in the first line. (You may print each letter in any case (for example, YES, Yes, yes, yEs will all be recognized as positive answer)\nIn the second line print M, the number of operations you want to perform. \nThen print M lines describing the operations. In the ith line, print the starting index L of the range [L,L+2i\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921] flipped in the ith operation.\nThe value of L+2i\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 should not exceed N in any operation. \n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n5 0\n3 3\n2 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\n0\nYES\n2\n3\n1\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1:\nSince K=0, all the characters of string S are already '0'. So, there is no need to perform any operation.\nTest case 2:\nWe have N=3 and K=3. So S=111. \n\nIn first operation, we can choose index 3 (21\xe2\x88\x921=1 indices) and flip it, giving S=110. \nIn the second operation, we can choose indices 1,2 (22\xe2\x88\x921=2 indices) and flip them, giving S=000. \n\nTherefore, we can make each character of S to '0' by flipping index 3 in first operation and indices 1 and 2 in the second operation.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nutkarsh_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BINFLIP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Constructive\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-09-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
