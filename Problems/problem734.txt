b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef Tobby asked Bhuvan to brush up his knowledge of statistics for a test. While studying some distributions, Bhuvan learns the fact that for symmetric distributions, the mean and the median are always the same.\nChef Tobby asks Bhuvan out for a game and tells him that it will utilize his new found knowledge. He lays out a total of 109 small tiles in front of Bhuvan. Each tile has a distinct number written on it from 1 to 109.\nChef Tobby gives Bhuvan an integer N and asks him to choose N distinct tiles and arrange them in a line such that the mean of median of all subarrays lies between [N-1, N+1], both inclusive. The median of subarray of even length is the mean of the two numbers in the middle after the subarray is sorted\nBhuvan realizes that his book didn\xe2\x80\x99t teach him how to solve this and asks for your help. Can you solve the problem for him?\nIn case, no solution exists, print -1.\nInput section\nFirst line contains, T, denoting the number of test cases.\nEach of the next T lines, contain a single integer N.\nOutput section\nIf no solution, exists print -1.\nIf the solution exists, output N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array A such that above conditions are satisfied. In case, multiple answers exist, you can output any one them.\nInput constraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 20\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1\n2\n3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n1 2\n1 2 3\n\n\nExplanation\nFor test case 3, the subarrays and their median are as follows: \n{1}, median = 1\n{2}, median = 2\n{3}, median = 3\n{1, 2}, median = 1.5\n{2, 3}, median = 2.5\n{1, 2, 3}, median = 2\nThe mean of the medians is 2 which lies in the range [2, 4]\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85likecs\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LIKECS02\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Arithmetic, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Basic Maths, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1666\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-09-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
