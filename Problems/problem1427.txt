b"\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a rooted tree with NN nodes numbered 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N. Node 1 is the root node. Some of the nodes have a token in them. In one move, you can choose a non-root node that has a token, but its parent doesn't, and move the token from this node to its parent. What is the maximum number of moves you can make?\nNote: When a token is moved out of a node, the node becomes empty, and other tokens will be able to move there.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case contains three lines.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer N, the number of nodes in the tree.\nThe second line contains a string s of length N. The character si is 1 if node has a token, and 0 otherwise.\nThe third line contains N\xe2\x88\x921 space separated integers, p2,p3,\xe2\x80\xa6pN, where pi is the parent of node i.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print the maximum number of moves that can be made on a new line.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\nFor each valid i,  1\xe2\x89\xa4pi<i.\nThe sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 106.\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (13 points): T\xe2\x89\xa410,N\xe2\x89\xa417.\nSubtask 2 (18 points): The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 2000.\nSubtask 3 (41 points): The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 105.\nSubtask 4 (28 points): No additional constraints.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5\n01010\n1 1 3 3\n5\n10101\n1 1 3 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the first test case, you can first move a token from node 4 to node 3, and then move a token from node 2 to node 1.\nIn the second test case, there are no possible valid moves.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85jtnydv25\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TRTOKENS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Segment Trees, DFS, Euler Tour, Range Minimum Queries\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals, Queries\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2885\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-05-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
