b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n \nYou are given a tree T with N nodes numbered 1 through N. Each node of the tree has a value; let's denote the value of node v by Cv. You are also given Q queries to process. There are two types of queries:\n\n1 U V W \xe2\x80\x94 add W to the value of each node on the path between nodes U and V (both inclusive)\n2 U V X \xe2\x80\x94 consider each node on the path between nodes U and V (both inclusive) whose value is \xe2\x89\xa5 X; compute the minimum of these nodes' values\n\n\nProcess the queries in the given order and compute the answer to each query of the second type.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers C1, C2, ..., CN.\nN-1 lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers U and V denoting an edge connecting nodes U and V.\nThe following Q lines describe queries. Each of them contains four space-separated integers type, U, V and either W (for type = 1) or X (for type = 2). Here, type denotes the type of the query.\n\nOutput\nFor each query of the second type, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum value \xe2\x89\xa5 X of a node on the given path which is, or -1 if no such value exists.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100,000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, Q \xe2\x89\xa4 100,000\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ci \xe2\x89\xa4 109 for each valid i\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 type \xe2\x89\xa4 2\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 X \xe2\x89\xa4 1014\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 W \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 U, V \xe2\x89\xa4 N\nthe graph described on the input is a tree\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of N over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 100,000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of Q over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 100,000\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (43 points): there are no queries of the first type (type = 2 for each query)\n\n\nSubtask #2 (57 points): original constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5 5\n10 15 20 15 10\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n2 5 3 3\n1 2 5 10\n2 1 4 4\n1 5 2 17\n2 1 5 100\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n10\n10\n-1\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85lg5293\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 hard, ltime58, mgch, square-root-decomposition, squareroot, super-node-tree\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-03-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
