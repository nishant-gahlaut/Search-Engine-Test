b"\nNayra doesn't like stories of people receiving random trees as birthday presents, but this time she received a tree as a present for her own birthday! After struggling for a day trying to figure out what to do with this tree, she asked Aryan for help. He gave her this problem.\nYou are given a tree with NN vertices and weighted edges. It is rooted at vertex 1.\nDefine g(u,v) to be the maximum weight of an edge on the shortest path between vertex u and vertex v in this tree.\nJust calculating g(u,v) is too easy, so you have to process Q queries.\nIn each query, you are given K distinct vertices v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vK. You have to compute the sum of the g-values of each pair of vertices among these K, i.e, the value\nK\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x91i=1K\xe2\x88\x91j=i+1g(vi,vj)\nNote: The input and output are large, so use fast input-output methods.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q, denoting the number of vertices in the tree and the number of queries respectively.\nThe second line contains N\xe2\x88\x921 space-separated integers P2,P3,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN, where Pi is the parent of vertex i.\nThe third line contains N\xe2\x88\x921 space-separated integers W2,W3,\xe2\x80\xa6,WN, where Wi is the weight of the edge between vertices i and Pi.\nThe next Q lines contain queries you will have to answer. The description of Q queries follows.\nThe i-th line contains an integer Ki followed by Ki distinct space-separated integers v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vKi, where Ki is the number of vertices in this query and v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6vKi denote the vertices themselves.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test, print one line containing Q space-separated integers. The i-th of these integers should be the answer to the i-th query.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa43\n10\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi<i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Wi\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85104\n10\xe2\x89\xa4Ki\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4vi\xe2\x89\xa4N\nAll vi present in a single query are distinct\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of Ki over all queries over all test cases in a single test file does not exceed 1.5\xe2\x8b\x85106\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of Q over all test cases in a single test file does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x85104\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n10 1\n1 2 2 3 5 4 4 8 8\n20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n10 1 4 5 6 2 3 7 8 9 10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3300\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n10 2\n1 2 2 3 5 4 4 8 8\n20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n4 1 4 5 6\n4 2 3 7 8\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n320 410\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the second sample:\nLet's look at different values of g(u,v) for this tree.\nFor the first query, g(1,4)=40, g(1,5)=50, g(1,6)=60, g(4,5)=50, g(4,6)=60, g(5,6)=60. The sum of all these values is 320.\nFor the second query, g(2,3)=30, g(2,7)=70, g(2,8)=80, g(3,7)=70, g(3,8)=80, g(7,8)=80. The sum of all these values is 410.\nNote: The second sample does not satisfy the constraint Ki\xe2\x89\xa510, so it won't be present in the actual test data. It's added here only for illustration.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85aryanc403\n\n\nTester:\nsuryaprak_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/YATP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Disjoint Set Union, Auxiliary Tree\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2890\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-11-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n4 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
