b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\n\n\tLet\'s consider a set of points S. Initially, S is an empty set. Your task is to implement a data structure that can process the following queries efficiently:\n\n\n\n\t\t\t"+ X Y" - add a new point P with coordinates (X, Y) to S. It\'s guaranteed that this point will not be in S.\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t"- N" - remove a point that was added during the N\'th adding query from S. All of the adding queries are numbered in the order of their appearance starting from 1 (queries of other types are not included). It\'s guaranteed that this point is in S.\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t"? X Y" - calculate the maximal Manhattan distance between a point P with coordinates (X, Y) and any point from S. It\'s guaranteed that S will not be empty.\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\tIn addition, you won\'t be given the exact query data, but instead should decode it in the following way:\n\n\n\tLet\'s store the result of the last processed query of the third type in a variable called ANSWER. Initially, ANSWER is equal to 0. You will be given X\', Y\' and N\' instead of the real values of X, Y and N. To get the real data you should perform the following computations:\n\n\n\nX = X\' xor ANSWER;\n\t\t\n\nY = Y\' xor ANSWER;\n\t\t\n\nN = N\' xor ANSWER.\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\tDon\'t forget to update the value of ANSWER after processing each query of the third type.\n\nNote\n\n\tMaybe some of you aren\'t familiar with some terms in the statement.
