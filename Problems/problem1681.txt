b'\nRead problem statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou want to rob a jewellery store.\nThe jewellery store sells $n$ different types of jewels and for each type it has $10^9$ identical jewels of that type.\nA jewel of the $i$-th type weighs $i$ grams and is worth $a_i$ euros.\nYou plan to steal exactly $k$ jewels with a total weight of exactly $w$ grams (you can steal multiple jewels of the same type). What is the maximum possible total value, in euros, of the stolen jewels?\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains the three integers $n$, $k$, $w$ \xe2\x80\x94 the number of types of jewels, the number of jewels you will steal, the total weight of the jewels you will steal. \nThe second line contains the $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ \xe2\x80\x94 the values in euros of the jewels.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint the maximum possible total value, in euros, of the stolen jewels if the robbery satisfies the constraints described in the statement.\nConstraints\n\n$1\\le n\\le 1\\,000$\n$1\\le k\\le 10^6$\n$k\\le w\\le kn$. Notice that under these constraints, one can show that there are $k$ jewels with a total weight equal to $w$.\n$1\\le a_i\\le 10^9$ for all $i= 1, 2,\\dots, n$.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3 2 4\n11 10 8\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\nExplanation\nThere are $3$ types of jewels:\n\nThe first type weighs $1$ gram and is worth $11$ euros.\nThe second type weighs $2$ grams and is worth $10$ euros.\nThe third type weighs $3$ grams and is worth $8$ euros.\n\nThe plan is to steal $2$ jewels with a total weight of $4$ grams. There are two valid choices of jewels to steal:\n\nWe may steal one jewel of type $1$ and one jewel of type $3$. In this way, the value of the stolen jewels would be $11 + 8 = 19$.\nWe may steal two jewels of type $2$. In this way, the value of the stolen jewels would be $2\\cdot 10 = 20$.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3 3 6\n10 5 8\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\nExplanation\nThe plan is to steal $3$ jewels with a total weight of $6$ grams. There are two valid choices of jewels to steal:\n\nWe may steal one jewel of type $1$, one jewel of type $2$, and one jewel of type $3$. In this way, the value of the stolen jewels would be $10 + 5 + 8=23$.\nWe may steal three jewels of type $2$. In this way, the value of the stolen jewels would be $3\\cdot 5 = 15$.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 3\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2 1000000 1994294\n454353453 941594523\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 3\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n938814325454580\n\n\nExplanation\nThere is only one valid choice of jewels to steal: $5706$ jewels of type $1$ and $994294$ jewels of type $2$. In this way, the value of the stolen jewels would be $5706\\cdot 454353453 + 994294\\cdot 941594523 = 938814325454580$.\n\n                        Sample Input 4\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5 11 40\n15 14 14 12 12\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 4\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n146\n\n\nExplanation\nThere are many valid choices of jewels to steal, one of the optimal choices (i.e., one of the choices which achieves the maximum total value of $146$) is: one jewel of type $2$, six jewels of type $3$, four jewels of type $5$.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85dario2994\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ROBBERYPLAN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dario2994, medium, snckfl21, snckfp21\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-01-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
