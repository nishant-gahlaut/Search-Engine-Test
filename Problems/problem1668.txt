b'\n"You know Walter, sometimes it doesn\'t hurt to have someone watching your back"\nThe Hitmen twins of the Juarez Cartel, Leonel and Marco Salamanca, often known as the "Cousins", have set off from Mexico in search of Walter White. They come across an informant, who only agrees to help them if they solve his puzzle of interesting numbers.\nThere are $N$ interesting numbers $A$$1$$,$ $A$$2$$,$ $...$ $A$$N$ consisting of integers from $1$ to $N$.\nThe task is to find $K$$th$ smallest $GCD$ among all $GCD$ $($ $A$$i$,$A$$j$$)$ for each $(i,j)$, such that $1 \\leq i < j \\leq N$.\nPrint the $K$$th$ smallest $GCD$ and also find any pair having the resultant $GCD$ (print their indices).\nInput:\n\nThe first line will contain $T$, number of testcases. $T$ testcases follow : \nThe first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N, K$. \nThe second line of each testcase contains $N$ space-separated integers $A$$1$$,$ $A$$2$$,$ $...,$$A$$N$.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print two lines. On the first line, print the $K$$th$ smallest $GCD$. On the second line, print any pair of indices $(x,y)$ such that $x$ != $y$ and $GCD$ $($ $A$$x$,$A$$y$$)$ = $K$$th$ smallest $GCD$.\nConstraints\n\n$1 \\leq T \\leq 10^4$\n$2 \\leq N \\leq 10^6$\n$1 \\leq K \\leq (N*(N-1))/2$\n$1 \\leq A$$i$ $  \\leq  N$\nThe sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$\n\nSample Input:\n2\n5 8\n2 4 4 1 3\n5 7\n2 4 4 1 3\n\nSample Output:\n2\n1 2\n1\n4 5     \n\nEXPLANATION:\n\nFor Test Case 1 :  $K$$th$ smallest $GCD$ is $2$, and $GCD$ $($ $A$$1$ , $A$$2$$)$ = $2$.\nFor Test Case 2 : $K$$th$ smallest $GCD$ is $1$, and $GCD$ $($ $A$$4$ , $A$$5$$)$ = $1$.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85abhi2402\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/KGCD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 GCD, Sieve of Eratosthenes, Inclusion Exclusion Principle\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Set Theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3056\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-10-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
