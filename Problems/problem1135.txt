The number -77 is also an odd number; but let's not talk about the negative ones, let's talk about the natural numbers.\nf(K)=K+h  ;  where h is any odd natural number.\nAs 'K' is odd, so f(K) would always result in an even number. Lisa liked this property very much. She took a number 'X' and computed all its factors. Let the number of distinct factors be 'G'. Now, if f(G) gives you an even number, \nthen she calls 'X' as a FACTO.\nNow she is thinking if she can print the FACTOS in a given range.\nInput: The first line contains T-the number of test cases. Each line of a test case contains the upper limit of the range 'X'.\nThe lower limit of each range is 1.\nOutput: The FACTOS in the given range separated by a single space.\nConstraints:\n1<=T<=10^5\n 1<=X<1000\nSample Input:\n2\n3\n6\nSample Output:\n1\n1 \xc2\xa0 4\nExplanation:\nIn case 1, the range is 3. so the X's are: 1,2,3.\nWe know that 1 only has one factor, i.e.: 1 itself! (odd number of factors)\n2 has two factors: 1,2 (even number of factors)\n3 has two factors: 1,3 (even number of factors)\nThus,1 is the only FACTO in the given range.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85kaushambi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FIFACT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, kaushambi, number-theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-09-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
