b'\nBob has n heap(s) of gravel (initially there are exactly c piece(s) in each). He wants to do m operation(s) with that heaps, each maybe:\nadding pieces of gravel onto the heaps from u to v, exactly k pieces for each,\nor querying "how many pieces of gravel are there in the heap p now?".\nRequest\nHelp Bob do operations of the second type.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains the integers n,m,c, respectively.\nm following lines, each forms:\nS u v k to describe an operation of the first type.\nQ p to describe an operation of the second type.\n(Each integer on a same line, or between the characters S, Q and the integers is separated by at least one space character)\nOutput\nFor each operation of the second type, output (on a single line) an integer answering to the respective query (follows the respective Input order).\nLimitations\n0<n\xe2\x89\xa4106\n0<m\xe2\x89\xa4250 000\n0<u\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa4n\n0\xe2\x89\xa4c,k\xe2\x89\xa4109\n0<p\xe2\x89\xa4n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n7 5 0\nQ 7\nS 1 7 1\nQ 3\nS 1 3 1\nQ 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nanhdq_adm\n\n\nTester:\n4\xe2\x98\x85rajivka\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SPREAD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Lazy Propagation, Implementation, Online Queries\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Segment Trees, Algorithms, Queries\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1822\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-05-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.268722 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, TCL, PERL, LUA, BASH, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, CLOJ, D, FORT, ASM, FS, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
