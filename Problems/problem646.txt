b'\nYou are given two positive integers aa and b. You also have a number x, which is initially set to 0. At first, you can add a to x any number of times. After that, you can divide x by b any number of times as long as x is divisible by b.\nPrint YES if you can make x equal to 1, otherwise print NO.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line of input will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case contains a single line, two positive integers a,b.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output on one line YES if it is possible to make x , or NO if it is not possible to do so. \nOutput is case insensitive, which means that "yes", "Yes", "YEs", "no", "nO" - all such strings will be acceptable.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n3 10\n9 6\n7 30\n8 12\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 2: We initially have x set to 0. Add a=9 to x for 4 times to make x equal to 36. And then divide x by b=6 for 2 times to make x equal to 1.\nTest case 4: We initially have x set to 0. Add a=8 to x for 18 times to make x equal to 144. And then divide x by b=12 for 2 times to make x equal to 1.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nutkarsh_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ADDNDIV\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Number Theory, Basic Maths\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1935\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-09-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
