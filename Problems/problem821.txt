b"\nChef is playing a game with his brother Chefu. He asked Chefu to choose a positive integer $N$, multiply it by a given integer $A$, then choose a divisor of $N$ (possibly $N$ itself) and add it to the product. Let's denote the resulting integer by $M$; more formally, $M = A \\cdot N + d$, where $d$ is some divisor of $N$.\nChefu told Chef the value of $M$ and now, Chef should guess $N$. Help him find all values of $N$ which Chefu could have chosen.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $M$.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print two lines. The first line should contain a single integer $C$ denoting the number of possible values of $N$. The second line should contain $C$ space-separated integers denoting all possible values of $N$ in increasing order.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $C$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^7$.\nConstraints\n\n$1 \\le T \\le 100$\n$2 \\le M \\le 10^{10}$\n$1 \\le A \\lt M$\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points):\n\n$M \\le 10^6$\n\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3 35\n5 50\n4 65\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n10\n0\n\n3\n13 15 16\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GUESSNUM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, Divisors\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Integer Factorisation\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1987\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-12-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
