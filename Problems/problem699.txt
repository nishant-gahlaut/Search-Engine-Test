b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n\nLittle Churu is a naughty child, who likes to play with balls. He has N buckets. Each bucket contains one or more balls. He has numbered his buckets 1 to N (both inclusive). He has an infinite supply of extra balls, apart from the ones already in the buckets. He wants to add zero or more number of balls to each of the buckets in such a way, that number of balls in the buckets are in a non-decreasing order, and their GCD is strictly greater than 1.\n\n \nHe wants to do it using the minimum number of extra balls. As he is too young to solve the problem, please help him with the solution.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nFor each test case, first line contains an integer N denoting the number of buckets.\nSecond line of each test case contains N space separated integers, where the ith denotes the number of balls in the ith bucket.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a line containing a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the answer for that test case.\n\nConstraints\n\nSubtask #1: 20 points\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T  \xe2\x89\xa4 10, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N  \xe2\x89\xa4 1000, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 number of balls in a bucket  \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n\n\n\nSubtask #2: 80 points\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T  \xe2\x89\xa4 10, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N  \xe2\x89\xa4 10000, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 number of balls in a bucket  \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3\n11 13 15\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nExplanation\n\nAdd one ball to each of the buckets.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85amitpandeykgp\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85antoniuk1\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CBALLS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Segmented Sieve\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Sieve of Eratosthenes\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1697\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-06-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
