b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\n\nMike is a famous traveler. He visits about 100 countries a year and buys the flag of each country he has been to.\n\n\nMike knows, that there are some flags, that correspond to one pattern, but colored in different ways. E.g. the flag of Ireland(link) and the flag of Belgium(link). In this problem we consider only five 2,2cm\xe2\x9c\x951,1cm patterns of flags:\n\n\n\n\nThere are N different colors available to paint the flags and the colors are denoted by integers from 1 to N.\nMike wants you to count the number of different well-painted flags. We call a flag well-painted if it's made according to the following algorithm:\n\nPick up one of the flag patterns considered above;\nPaint each one-colored polygon on the pattern in a color encoded by an integer from 1 to N. Different colors are encoded with different integers. If two different one-colored polygons share a common side(not corner), than they must be painted in different colors. In any other case they can be painted in both equal and different colors.\n\nTwo flags are different, if they look different(have at least one pixel painted with different color).\n\n\nHelp Mike!\n\nText version of the pictures: \nPicture 1\n\n112233\n112233\n112233\n\n\n111111\n222222\n333333\n\n\n112222\n112222\n113333\n\n\n122223\n111333\n144443\n\n\n111222\n333222\n333444\n\nPicture 2\n\n112211\n112211\n112211\n\n\n221122\n221122\n221122\n\n\n111111\n222222\n111111\n\n\n222222\n111111\n222222\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains integer T, denoting the number of testcases.
