b'\nThere are some short-cut ways to check divisibility of numbers in base 10. Here are some examples:\n\nRemember divisibility testing of 3 in base 10? It was simple, right? We need to add all the digits and then check if it is divisible by 3. Call this method "1-sum".\nIn case of testing of 11, we need to add all digits by alternating their signs. For example,\xe2\x80\xa81354379988104 = 11*123125453464 and (4-0+1-8+8-9+9-7+3-4+5-3+1) = 0, which is divisible by 11 (0 = 0*11).  Lets call this method "1-altersum".\nIn case of 7, we need to add all 3-digit-groups by alternating their signs. For example,\xe2\x80\xa8 8618727529993 = 7*1231246789999 and (993-529+727-618+8) = 581, which is divisible by 7 (581 = 7*83). Similarly, we call this method "3-altersum".\nIn similar Manner, 13\xe2\x80\x99s checking is "3-altersum".\n\nIn this problem, we are interested to see divisibility checking of only prime numbers in base 10. For a prime P, you need to find the smallest positive integer N such that P\xe2\x80\x99s divisibility testing is "N-sum" or "N-altersum".\nInput\nAt first you will be given T (T \xe2\x89\xa4 1000), the number of test cases. Then T lines will follow. In each line there will be single integer P (P \xe2\x89\xa4 231-1 = 2147483647), the prime number (P is a prime number NOT equal to 2 or 5).\nOutput\nFor each line of input, produce exactly one line of output like either "Case <test-case>: <N>-sum" or "Case <test-case>: <N>-altersum". Please see sample input and output for details.\nSample Input\n4\n3\n7\n11\n13\nOutput\nCase 1: 1-sum\nCase 2: 3-altersum\nCase 3: 1-altersum\nCase 4: 3-altersum\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nkol_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/KOL16E\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Fermat\'s Little Theorem, Modulo Multiplicative Inverse\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Modular Arithmetic\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-12-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n40000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
