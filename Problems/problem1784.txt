b'\n\xc2\xa0\n\nFluffy has a graph of n vertices and m edges. Each edge has a color ci.  Three vertices a, b, c form a triangle if and only if there is an edge connecting a and b, b and c, a and c respectively. A triangle is called colorful if all three of its edges are of pairwise distinct colors. Fluffy wants to find all colorful triangles in the graph. Can you help him?\n\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nThe first line contains 3 space-seperated integers, n, m and C, the number of vertices, the number of edges and the number of possible colors. The next m lines contain 3 space-seperated integers. The first two integers denote the endpoints of the edge. The last integer denotes the color of the edge.\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nOn the first line, output T, the number of colorful triangles. If T is not more than 100000, then output T lines, each line containing a triple of integers a, b, c, denoting a colorful triangle. You must output the values a, b, c so that a \xe2\x89\xa4 b \xe2\x89\xa4 c holds. Additionally, the triangles must be printed in lexicographical order. A triangle (a, b, c) is lexicographically smaller than (d, e, f) if either a < d, a = d, b < e or a = d, b = e, c < f. It is guaranteed that the graph do not contain self-loops or multiedges.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n, m, C \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (16 points) : 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n, m \xe2\x89\xa4 5000\nSubtask 2 (44 points) : The colors of all edges are distinct.\nSubtask 3 (40 points) : Original Constraints\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n4 5 6\n1 2 2\n1 3 3\n1 4 1\n2 3 1\n3 4 3\n\nOutput:\n1\n1 2 3\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case. There is only one colorful triangle, (1, 2, 3). Note that (1, 3, 4) is a triangle, but it is not colorful, since the edge 1 - 3 and 3 - 4 have the same color. Also note that the output 2 3 1, 3 1 2 will be marked as incorrect as the vertices are not sorted in increasing order.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85zscoder\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MCO16505\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 medium, sqrt-decomp, zscoder\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-11-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
