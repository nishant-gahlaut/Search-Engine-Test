b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nYou are given N non-negative integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. You are allowed to perform following operation any number of times:\n\nChoose any valid index i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N) and a positive integer M>0 and replace Ai with AimodM. That is, replace Ai with its remainder when divided by M, which is a value between 0 and M\xe2\x88\x921, inclusive. \nM does not need to be same between different operations.\n\nFind the minimum number of operations to make all the array elements equal.\nNote: Since the input and output are large, prefer using fast input-output methods.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains an integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of array.\nThe second line contains N integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN - the elements of the array.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test, print one line containing an integer which denotes minimum number of operations performed to make all the elements equal.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85109\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n2 1 3\n3\n1 1 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nIn first test case, we can make all the elements equal by following operations:\n\nTake i=1 and M=2 and do A1:=A1mod2=0.\nTake i=2 and M=1 and do A2:=A2mod1=0.\nTake i=3 and M=3 and do A3:=A3mod3=0.\nAfter these 3 operations we have all the elements equal to zero.\n\nIn second test case, we can perform following operation: \n\nChoose i=3 and M=2 and do A3:=A3mod2=1.\nAfter this operation all the elements are 1.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85vichitr\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85aryanc403\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MODEQUAL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1842\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-07-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
