Everyone knows that the best spices are guarded by several ancient dragons that dwell within mountains.\nThe mountain range can be modeled by a polyline in the 2D xzxz plane that passes through NN points p1=(1,h1),p2=(2,h2),\xe2\x80\xa6,pN=(N,hN)p1=(1,h1),p2=(2,h2),\xe2\x80\xa6,pN=(N,hN), in this order, where hi is a positive integer for each valid i. This polyline divides the set of points {(x,z):1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4N} into two regions. The "solid" part of the mountain range is the "bottom" region, i.e. the region that contains the x-axis (the x-axis is the line z=0).\nA dragon\'s den is located at each of the N points. For each valid i, the den at the point pi initially contains a pile of spices with tastiness ai. With a technique he learned from dragons, Chef can glide from den to den, tasting all of the spices along the way. The tastiness of an entire journey is the summed up tastiness of spices over all dens visited during the journey. However, there are some restrictions:\n\nChef can only glide from a higher den to a strictly lower den, i.e. if he glides from a den at pi to a den at pj, then hi>hj must hold.\nChef can only glide in one direction and never look back, i.e. if he starts travelling in the direction of decreasing x, he must keep travelling in that direction until the end of the journey, and if he starts travelling in the direction of increasing x, he must keep travelling in that direction until the end of the journey too.\nChef cannot travel through solid mountain, i.e. he can only glide from a den at pi to a den at pj if the line segment connecting the points pi and pj does not intersect the "solid" part of the mountain range. However, it may touch the border of the mountain range, i.e. the polyline itself.\n\nNote that gliding is the only way for Chef to travel between dens.  It is valid for a journey to begin and end at the same den, in which case Chef tastes the spices at the den and nothing else.\nSee the explanation of the sample test case for a concrete example.\nWith that in mind, Chef needs you to process Q queries. There are two types of queries:\n\n1 b k: Chef changes his mind and decides that the tastiness of the spices in the den at the point pb should be changed to k instead.\n2 b c: Chef wants to start a journey at the den located at pb and end it at the den located at pc. Find the maximum possible tastiness of such a journey or determine that no such journey exists. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and Q.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers h1,h2,\xe2\x80\xa6,hN.\nThe third line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN.\nThen, Q lines follow. Each of these lines contains three space-separated integers describing a query in the above format.\n\nOutput\nFor each query of the second type, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum tastiness of a journey or \xe2\x88\x921 if no valid journey exists.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4b,c\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask 1 (10 points): N,Q\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nSubtask 2 (35 points): there are no queries of the first type\nSubtask 3 (55 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5 4\n3 1 4 1 5\n1 2 4 8 16\n2 5 2\n1 3 5\n2 3 4\n2 1 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n22\n13\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nHere is an illustration of the mountain range described in the first sample test case.\n\n\nQuery 1: Starting at p5 (height 5), Chef can glide to p3 (height 4) and then to p2 (height 1). The total tastiness of this journey is a5+a3+a2=16+4+2=22.\n\n \n\nQuery 2: The value of a3 is set to 5.\nQuery 3: Chef glides from p3 to p4. The tastiness is a3+a4=5+8=13.\nQuery 4: It is impossible to get from p1 to p4. Even if h1>h4, to reach p4, Chef would need to fly either upwards or through the mountain, both of which are impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85shisuko\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DRGNDEN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Stacks, Trees, Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, HLD, DFS Order\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals, DFS\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2355\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-03-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
