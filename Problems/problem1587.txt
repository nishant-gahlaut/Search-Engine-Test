b'\n\nA string is called beautiful if it has the form AArAAr where A is some non-empty string and Ar is the reversed A.\nYou are given a string S composed only of lowercase letters of the English alphabet. Find the number of its beautiful substrings. Equal substrings in different positions are considered different. For example, the string aaaaa has 2 different substrings because we have beautiful substring aaaa in two different positions.\n\nInput\n The first line contains a single integer T <= 10, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a non-empty string composed only of lowercase letters of the English alphabet. The length of the string is not greater than 100000.\n\nOutput\n For each test case, output a single line containing the number of beautiful substrings of the corresponding string.\n\nExample\nInput:\n6\naaaa\naaaaa\nabbaabba\nabbaabb\nabaaba\nxxyyxxxxyyxx\n\nOutput:\n1\n2\n1\n0\n0\n2\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85anton_adm\n\n\nTester:\nfriggstad\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PALIPALI\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Balanced Binary Search Tree, Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, Hashing, Binary Search, Manachers Algorithm\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Tree Data Structure, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Algorithms, Searching, String Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2392\n\n\nDate Added:\n6-03-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.24 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
