b'\nCodeChef Inc. owns a rectangular piece of land sized w\xc3\x97h.  Its edges are parallel to the axes, with the bottom-left corner at (0,0) and top-right corner at (w,h).  They intend to build a new head office within this land.  The new office will be a square whose center is located at a point with integer coordinates, and whose diagonals are parallel to the axes and have length 2*d.\nUnfortunately, there are n barricades on the land, some of which may need to be removed in order for the office to be built.  The (i)th barricade is located at (Xi, Yi) and will cost Ci to remove.  The office may only be built once all points it covers (including the boundaries) are free of barricades.\n\nRequest\nHelp them find the minimum total cost of barricade removal.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains the integers w,h,d,n, respectively.\nWithin following n lines, the i-th line contains the integers Xi,Yi,Ci respectively.\n\nOutput\nOutput on a single line an integer which is the minimum cost found.\nExample\nInput:\n4 3 1 4\n1 3 5\n3 3 4\n2 2 1\n2 1 2\n\nOutput:\n2\n\nLimitations\n\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4w,h\xe2\x89\xa41 000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4200 000\n2\xe2\x89\xa42d\xe2\x89\xa4min(w,h)\n0<Ci\xe2\x89\xa410 000\nAll the listed barricades are inside or on the boundaries of the CodeChef\xe2\x80\x99s land.\nThere is at most one barricade at each point.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nanhdq_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85pieguy\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BUILDING\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Prefix Sum, Coordinate Rotation\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Computational Geometry, Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2249\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-05-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.111317 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
