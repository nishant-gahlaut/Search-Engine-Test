b'\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Russian, Mandarin and Vietnamese as well.\nA sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN of length N is called good if any one of the following hold:\n\nThe sequence is strictly increasing, or\nThe sequence is strictly decreasing, or\nThere exists an index i(1<i<N) such that:\nAj<Aj+1, for each 1\xe2\x89\xa4j<i\nAj>Aj+1, for each i\xe2\x89\xa4j<N \n\nFor example, the sequences [3,5,9], [2,1], [5,7,4,1] are good, while [6,7,7], [5,2,3] are not. \nYou are given an array A consisting of N integers. Find a good sequence by rearranging the elements of the array A or report that this is impossible. If there are multiple good sequences, print the lexicographically largest one.\nIf two sequences A and B have the same length N, we say that A is lexicographically larger than B if there exists an index i, (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N) such that A1=B1,A2=B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ai\xe2\x88\x921=Bi\xe2\x88\x921 and Ai>Bi.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer N, denoting the length of the array.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN, denoting the given array.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, if it is not possible to rearrange the given array into a good sequence, print \xe2\x88\x921. Otherwise, print a single line containing N space-separated integers - the lexicographically largest good sequence that can be made.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\nSum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (100 points): Original constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n3\n2 3 5\n3\n1 1 1\n5\n5 7 2 1 2\n5\n1 2 3 2 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5 3 2\n-1\n2 7 5 2 1\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: The rearrangements of A which are good sequences are: [5,3,2], [3,5,2], [2,3,5], [2,5,3]. Among these, [5,3,2] is the lexicographically largest.\nTest case 2: There is no way to obtain a good sequence by rearranging the elements of the array A=[1,1,1].\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85soumyadeep_21\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/HILLSEQ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 1D Arrays, Sorting, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1743\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-11-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
