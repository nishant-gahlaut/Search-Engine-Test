b"\nFelicity (the annual fest of IIITH) is coming and you are the leader of the logistics team. Felicity's leader asked you to get colourful tape for N square shaped photo frames and gave you the area of those N squares, ith frame has an area Ai. The tape will be used on the border of those photo frames and hence, the tape required by a photo frame is equal to the length of its border.\nBeing a responsible leader of the logistics team you cannot bring extra stuff that gets wasted. Find out what is the total length of the colourful tape required.   \nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains one positive integer N denoting the number of photo frames.\nThe next line contains N space-separated non-negative floating-point numbers Ai denoting the area of photo frames. \n\nOutput Format\nOutput the required length of tape for N photo frames. The difference between your output and the correct answer should not exceed 10\xe2\x88\x923.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n4.0 9.0 6.25 12.25 16.0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n60.000\n\n\nExplanation\nThe required length for each frame is\n1. 8.0\n2. 12.0\n3. 10.0\n4. 14.0\n5. 16\n\nTotal = 60.\nHack case note\nFind the buggy solution to this problem on GitHub or Drive.\nThis problem is part of the DeCode contest, wherein you are given a problem (as given above) and its buggy solution (link in contest announcement).
