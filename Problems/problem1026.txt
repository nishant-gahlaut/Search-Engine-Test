b'\nGiven N separate integer points on the Cartesian plane satisfying: there is no any three of them sharing a same X-coordinate. Your task is to count the number of rectangles (whose edges parrallel to the axes) created from any four of given points.\n\nInput\nThere are several test cases (ten at most), each formed as follows:\nThe first line contains a positive integer N (N \xe2\x89\xa4 105).\nN lines follow, each containing a pair of integers (each having an absolute value of 109 at most) describing coordinates of a given point.\n\nThe input is ended with N = 0.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output on a line an integer which is the respective number of rectangles found.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n6\n7 1\n3 5\n3 1\n1 5\n1 1\n7 5\n0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nanhdq_adm\n\n\nTester:\n4\xe2\x98\x85rajivka\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RECTCNT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Maps, Loops, Basic Maths, Cartesian Coordinate System, ad-hoc, Sorting, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Basic Programming Concepts, Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1770\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-03-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.176 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
