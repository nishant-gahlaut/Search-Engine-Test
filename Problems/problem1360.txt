b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a an array A consisting of N elements. He wants to add some elements into the array as per the below mentioned process.\nAfter each minute, Chef iterates over the array in order from left to right, and takes every two neighbouring pair of elements, say x and y, he adds a new element x + y in the middle of elements x and y.\nFor example, if initial array A = {1, 6, 9}.\n\nAfter first minute, the array A will be equal to {1, 7, 6, 15, 9}. Please note that the elements shown in the bold font are the newly added elements during first minute. As you can observe that 7 = 1 + 6, and 15 = 6 + 9.\nAfter second minute, the array will be {1, 8, 7, 13, 6, 21, 15, 24, 9}. Once again, elements added during the second minute, are shown in bold.\n\nChef wants to know the sum of elements between xth and yth positions in the array A (i.e. Ax + Ax + 1 + ... + Ay) after m minutes. As the answer could be large, output it modulo 109+7 (1000000007). Please note that we use 1 based indexing in the problem.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers N, m, x, y denoting the number of elements in the array A in the beginning, amount of minutes and range for finding sum.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the array A in the beginning. \n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the sum of elements between xth and yth positions in the array A after m minutes modulo 109+7.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 103\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 m \xe2\x89\xa4 30\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 x \xe2\x89\xa4 y \xe2\x89\xa4 size of the array A (|A|) after m minutes\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n3 1 1 5\n1 6 9\n3 2 6 7\n1 6 9\n\nOutput:\n38\n36\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.\nAfter the first minute A = {1, 7, 6, 15, 9} and sum of all elements will be 38.\n\nExample case 2.\nAfter the second minute the array A will be {1, 8, 7, 13, 6, 21, 15, 24, 9} and sum of elements between 6th and 7th equals to 21 + 15 = 36.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85antoniuk1\n\n\nTester:\n\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHSPARR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Algebra, Series, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-07-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
