b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi and Bengali\nThis is an interactive problem.\nSonya is a very creative and dreamy person, so she decided to open her own bakery one day. Since Sonya lives in a country where the traditional dish is apple pie, the business quickly became successful, and after a while, Sonya already had a chain of NN bakeries \xe2\x80\x94 one in each of the NN cities of the country. The cities are numbered 11 through NN and the bakeries are numbered in the same way as the cities. At each moment, each bakery has a certain number of pies in stock; let's denote the number of pies in stock in city ii by AiAi.\nAll the bakeries bake unique pies, so the country has built N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 roads in such a way that it is possible to reach any city from all other cities using these roads (and possibly visiting other cities on the way). The roads are numbered 11 through N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921. Unfortunately, in the country where Sonya lives, earthquakes happen frequently, so roads can collapse. It is impossible to use a collapsed road until it is repaired.\nFor each bakery, let's define its connected component as the set of all bakeries (including itself) which can be reached from it without using any collapsed roads.\nYou should process MM events. There are seven types of events, each of them corresponds to something changing in the country or Sonya asking for information related to her business:\n\ntype 11: The state of the EE-th road changes \xe2\x80\x94 if it was not collapsed, it collapses, and if it was collapsed, it is repaired (and becomes not collapsed).\ntype 22: The XX-th bakery bakes and delivers YY pies to each bakery in its connected component (including itself). In other words, for each bakery ii in the connected component of bakery XX, AiAi increases by YY.\ntype 33: Each bakery from the connected component of the XX-th bakery sends all the pies it has in stock to the XX-th bakery, which adds them to its stock.\ntype 44: Sonya wants to know the number of pies in stock in the XX-th bakery.\ntype 55: Sonya wants to know the total number of pies in stock in the connected component of the XX-th bakery.\ntype 66: Each bakery from the connected component of the XX-th bakery (including itself) sells all the pies it had in stock. In other words, for each bakery ii in the connected component of bakery XX, AiAi becomes 00.\ntype 77: Sonya wants to know the minimum number of roads which need to be repaired so that for each pair of bakeries ii and jj such that Ai>0Ai>0 and Aj>0Aj>0, it is possible to reach bakery ii from bakery jj without using any collapsed roads.\n\nYou need to answer all of Sonya's queries (for events of types 44, 55 and 77). The queries need to be answered online, i.e. you must answer each query in order to receive information about the subsequent events from the grader.\nInteraction\n\nFirst, you must read a line containing a single integer GG \xe2\x80\x94 the number of the current subtask.\nThen, you must read a line containing two space-separated integers NN and MM.\nThen, you must read N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 lines. For each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x921), the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting the cities connected by the ii-th road.\nThen, you must read a line containing a single string with length N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921. For each valid ii, the ii-th character of this string is '1' if the ii-th road is initially collapsed or '0' if it is not collapsed.\nThen, you must read a line containing NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN \xe2\x80\x94 the number of pies in stock initially.\nFinally, you must repeat the following process MM times:\nRead a line describing an event. This line begins with an integer denoting the type of the event.\nFor queries of type 11, this integer is followed by a space and a single integer EE.\nFor queries of type 22, it is followed by a space and two space-separated integers XX and YY.\nFor queries of types 33 through 66, it is followed by a space and a single integer XX.\nFor queries of type 77, it is not followed by anything else.\nIf the type of the event was 44, 55 or 77, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the answer to this query.\n\nDon't forget to flush the output after printing each line!\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4G\xe2\x89\xa451\xe2\x89\xa4G\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4250,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4250,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41050\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4105 for each valid ii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4E\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4E\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x921\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4N\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Y\xe2\x89\xa41050\xe2\x89\xa4Y\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa43,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa43,000\nSubtask #2 (20 points):\n\nthere are no queries of type 77\nin each event of type 11, a road that was collapsed is repaired\n\nSubtask #3 (25 points): there are no queries of type 77\nSubtask #4 (15 points): each city is directly connected to at most two other cities (by collapsed or uncollapsed roads)\nSubtask #5 (30 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n5 11\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n3 5\n0100\n1 0 6 1 3\n5 3\n3 4\n2 5 4\n4 3\n7\n6 4\n1 2\n5 4\n2 2 1\n1 3\n5 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n10\n4\n1\n1\n5\n\n\nExplanation\nThe following images depict the initial state of the country (Image 0) and after each event that changes the state of the country (Image 1 through Image 6, in chronological order). Bakeries/cities are depicted as circles, uncollapsed roads as regular lines between them and collapsed roads as dashed lines. Inside each circle, there are two integers \xe2\x80\x94 the number of the city/bakery and the number of pies it has in stock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85smelskiy\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SONIQUE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 april19, data-structure, hard, melfice, segment-tree, smelskiy, treap, trees\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3048\n\n\nDate Added:\n3-04-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
