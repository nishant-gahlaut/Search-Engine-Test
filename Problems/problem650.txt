b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. You may perform the following operation any number of times: select any two adjacent elements Ai and Ai+1 and replace one of them with Ai+Ai+12 (a real number, i.e. without rounding). You may also select each pair of adjacent elements and each element to replace in multiple operations, i.e. any number of times.\nIs it possible to make the sequence strictly increasing in a finite number of operations?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "Yes" if it is possible to make the sequence strictly increasing or "No" otherwise (without quotes).\nYou may print each character of each string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450,000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n2\n7 4\n3\n1 2 2\n5\n5 5 5 5 5\n8\n7 2 4 1 6 8 3 9\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNo\nYes\nNo\nYes\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Clearly, after any sequence of operations, A1>A2 holds, so it is impossible to make the sequence strictly increasing.\nExample case 2:  Choose A1 and A2 and change A2 to 1+22. The sequence after this operation is [1,1.5,2], which is a strictly increasing sequence. \nThere may also be other valid sequences of operations that give a strictly increasing sequence.\nExample case 3: No matter which pair of adjacent elements we choose, we can only change one of them to 5+52=5, so the sequence always remains [5,5,5,5,5].\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85explodingfrz\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/AVGSORT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1996\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-02-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
