b"\nA Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv likes lucky strings, i.e., the strings that consist only of the lucky digits 4 and 7.\nThe Little Elephant calls some string T of the length M balanced if there exists at least one integer X (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 X \xe2\x89\xa4 M) such that the number of digits 4 in the substring T[1, X - 1] is equal to the number of digits 7 in the substring T[X, M]. For example, the string S = 7477447 is balanced since S[1, 4] = 7477 has 1 digit 4 and S[5, 7] = 447 has 1 digit 7. On the other hand, one can verify that the string S = 7 is not balanced.\n The Little Elephant has the string S of the length N. He wants to know the number of such pairs of integers (L; R) that 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 L \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4 N and the substring S[L, R]  is balanced. Help him to find this number.\nNotes.\n\nLet S be some lucky string. Then\n\n|S| denotes the length of the string S;\n\nS[i] (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 |S|) denotes the ith character of S (the numeration of characters starts from 1);\n\n S[L, R] (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 L \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4 |S|) denotes the string with the following sequence of characters: S[L], S[L + 1], ..., S[R], and is called a substring of S. For L > R we mean by S[L, R] an empty string.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input file contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contains one string, the string S for the corresponding test case. The input file does not contain any whitespaces.\nOutput\nFor each test case output a single line containing the answer for this test case.\n\nConstraints\n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n S consists only of the lucky digits 4 and 7.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n47\n74\n477\n4747477\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2\n3\n23\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the first test case balance substrings are S[1, 1] = 4 and S[1, 2] = 47.\nIn the second test case balance substrings are S[2, 2] = 4 and S[1, 2] = 74.\nUnfortunately, we can't provide you with the explanations of the third and the fourth test cases. You should figure it out by yourself. Please, don't ask about this in comments.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85witaliy_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85anton_lunyov\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LUCKYBAL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Loops, Basic Maths, ad-hoc, Observation, Substring\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Basic Programming Concepts, Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive, Groupings\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1940\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-03-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.352645 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
