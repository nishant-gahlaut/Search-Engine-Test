b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nYou are given a tree (an acyclic undirected connected graph) with n nodes. The tree nodes are numbered from 1 to n. Each node has a color, white or black. All the nodes are black initially. We will ask you to perfrom some instructions of the following form:\n\n0 u: ask for how many nodes are connected to u, two nodes are connected if all the node on the path from u to v (inclusive u and v) have the same color.\n1 u: toggle the color of u (that is, from black to white, or from white to black).\n\nInput\nThe first line contains a number n that denotes the number of nodes in the tree (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 105). In each of the following n-1 lines, there will be two numbers (u, v) that describes an edge of the tree (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 u, v \xe2\x89\xa4 n). The next line contains a number m denoting number of operations we are going to process (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 m \xe2\x89\xa4 105). Each of the following m lines describe an operation (t, u) as we mentioned above(0 \xe2\x89\xa4 t \xe2\x89\xa4 1, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 u \xe2\x89\xa4 n).\nOutput\nFor each query operation, output the corresponding result.\nExample\nInput 1:5\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n1 5\n3\n0 1\n1 1\n0 1\nOutput 1:5\n1\nInput 2:7\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n3 6\n3 7\n4\n0 1\n1 1\n0 2\n0 3\nOutput 2:7\n3\n3Warning: large input/output data,be careful with certain languages\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85xiaodao\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85gerald\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/QTREE6\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Segment Trees, HLD, Link Cut Tree\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2605\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-11-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
