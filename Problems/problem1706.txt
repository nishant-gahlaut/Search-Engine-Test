b'\n\xc2\xa0\nRahul has been given a new task.\nHe has been given N points on the x-axis, X1,X2,...,XN.\nNow he is being asked Q queries. Each query gives him his position on the x-axis X, and asks him the sum of distances from his position and the N points.\nAs the sum can be quite large, he has been told to print the answer modulo 7630367.\nHe has written a program to calculate every query, but it seems to be giving him vague answers. \nHelp him... \n\n\xc2\xa0\nFlawed code\n\n#include  \n#define ll long long\nusing namespace std;\nint main(){\n    int n,x,q;\n    cin>>n>>q;\n    int a[n+1],b[n+1],mod=7630367;\n    for(int i=0;i!=n;i++){\n        cin>>x;\n        a[x]++;b[x]++;}\n    ll upd=0;\n    for(int i=0;i!=n+1;i++){\n        upd=a[i]%mod;a[i]=(a[i-1]+upd)%mod;}\n    upd=0;\n    for(int i=n;i>=0;i--){\n        upd=b[i]%mod;b[i]=(b[i+1]+upd)%mod;}\n    while(q--){cin>>x;printf("%lld",(a[x]+b[x])%mod);}}\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers N denoting the number of points on x-axis, Q denoting number of queries.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers X1, X2, ..., XN denoting the points on x-axis.\n\nThe next Q lines contains a single integer X, denoting the new position of Rahul\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\n\nFor each query, output a single line containing the answer.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Xi, X \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n3 2\n1 3 5\n3\n4\n\nOutput:\n4\n5\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85vibhor3gupta\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHKDST\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 array, flfi2016, implementation, medium, medium-hard, vibhor3gupta\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-03-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP14, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
