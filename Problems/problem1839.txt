b'\nAmy and Penny are very good Friends. They are also very competitive with each other in solving the problems of competitive programming. One day Amy challenges Penny to solve this problem.\nGiven is an undirected tree of NN nodes, rooted at node 1. Each node i has some capacity A[i] associated with it.\nPenny has to answer Q queries.\nIn each query, Penny is given an integer S and a node X. For each query she has to find the Happy Sequence of the node X.\nA sequence of nodes will be called as "Happy sequence" only if,\n(I) The first node of the sequence is X,\n(II) Each node is the child of the previous node in the sequence. \n(III) Sum of capacities of nodes in the sequence should be less than or equal to S.\nQuite stunned with the above problem, Penny asks you to help her in finding the length of the Happy Sequence with the maximum length.  \n\nInput:\n\nThe first line will contain N, the number of nodes in the tree.\nNext N\xe2\x88\x921 lines consist of two integer u and v denoting the edge between the nodes u and v. \nNext line consists of N integers corresponding to the capacities of the nodes.\nNext line consists of a single integer Q, the number of queries.\nNext Q lines consist of two integers X and S.\n\n\nOutput:\nFor each query, print the length of the Happy Sequence with maximum length.  in a new line.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\nSample Input:\n5\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n3 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n5\n1 0\n1 2\n1 3\n1 8\n2 1\n\n\nSample Output:\n0\n1\n2\n3\n0\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nQuery 1: There is no Happy Sequence.\nQuery 2: There is one Happy sequence: (1) of length 1.\nQuery 3: There is one Happy sequence: (1,2) of length 2.\nQuery 4: The largest Happy sequence is: (1,3,4) of length 3.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85avi892nash\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COG1806\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 avi892nash, codigo2k18, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-11-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
