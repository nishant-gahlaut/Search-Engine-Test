b'\nThe electrical resistance is the opposition to the passage of electric current. If two resistors with resistance R1 and R2 are connected to each other, the resultant resistance R depends on how their ends are connected. If they are connected in Series, they simply add up to give R = R1 + R2. If they are connected in Parallel, its given by the equation 1/R = 1/R1 + 1/R2. This is shown below.\n\nWe have a long circuit of resistors of one unit resistance each ( Ri = 1 ) having N blocks. Each block has 2 resistors as shown in the figure below. For a circuit with only one block (N=1), the equivalent resistance at the ends on left-side is R = 1 ( note that the right-most horizontally aligned resistor has no influence, as its not part of any simple path between the two left ends ). For a circuit with two blocks (N=2), its 2/3 units. This is shown in the figure below.\n\nGiven N, find the resistance A/B at the left ends of the circuit having N blocks. The values can be huge, so reduce the fraction A/B to lowest terms P/Q, where greatest_common_divisor_of (P,Q) = 1 and print (P%M)/(Q%M) for a given modulo M.\n\n\nInput\nFirst line contains T ( number of test cases, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10 ). Each of the next T lines contains N M ( 1 <= N <= 106 and 2 <=M <= 230 )\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the equivalent resistance at the left ends, in the form (P%M)/(Q%M) as explained above, in a separate line.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1 10\n2 12\n100 10000\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1/1\n2/3\n4301/9525\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nanil_adm\n\n\nTester:\nMaksflow\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RESIST\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 anil_adm, cook21, easy\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1761\n\n\nDate Added:\n3-04-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
