b"\nWe define a function ff on a binary string S of length N as follows:\nf(S)=\xe2\x88\x91N\xe2\x88\x921i=1|Si+1\xe2\x88\x92Si|.\nJJ and Uttu have a binary string S of length N and they decide to play a game using it. The rules of the game are as follows:\n\nJJ starts the game with players making moves in alternate turns thereafter.\nIn one move, a player can pick L,R such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N and flip all the characters in SL\xe2\x80\xa6R (Flipping a character means changing 0 to 1 or 1 to 0).\nA player can only make a move if that move increases the value of f(S).\nThe player who can not make any further moves loses.\n\nWhich player (out of JJ and Uttu) will win the game, assuming that both the players play optimally?\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains N -  the length of the binary string S.\nThe second line of each test case contains a binary string S.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output which player wins the game, whether it's JJ and Uttu will win the game.\nYou may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings JJ, Jj and jj will all be treated as identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n5\n10011\n2\n00\n5\n10101\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nJJ\nJJ\nUttu\n\n\nExplanation\n\nTest case 1: JJ can perform the following move: 1001_1\xe2\x86\x9210101. Now Uttu cannot perform any moves and thereby loses.\nTest case 2: JJ can perform the following move: 00_\xe2\x86\x9201. Now Uttu cannot perform any moves and thereby loses.\nTest case 3: JJ cannot perform any starting moves, thereby he loses.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85jeevanjyot\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85aryanc403\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BINSTRGAME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, nim game, Sprague Grundy Theorem\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms, Game Theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2179\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-12-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
