b'\nChef is very popular in UnderBelly. He is known for his talent of making a dish worst or best by changing the ingredients. Once a programmer visits UnderBelly, and he got to know about the chef\xe2\x80\x99s talent. The Programmer decided to test the chef. You are the chef, and you have to prove yourself by solving this problem.\nGiven an array of integers, you can change at most K number of elements by inverting any bit of a number at most one time (including zero). Such that\n\nwhen N is even the resulting array is lexicographically maximum.\nelse when N is odd the resulting array is lexicographically minimum.\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers - N,K respectively.\nThe second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN respectively.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x95 the changed array.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n\nSample Input:\n    4\n    6 1\n    1 2 3 4 5 6\n    8 2\n    8 7 15 31 16 14 18 48\n    3 3\n    12 22 32\n    5 5\n    1 2 3 4 5\n\nSample Output:\n1 3 3 4 5 6\n12 7 15 31 24 14 18 48\n4 6 0\n0 0 1 0 1\n\nEXPLANATION:\nExample case 1:\nThe array can be changed to make it lexicographically maximum by inverting the LSB bit of 2.\nExample case 2:\nThe array can be changed to make it lexicographically maximum by inverting a bit of 8 and 16 to make them 12 and 24 respectively.\n8\xe2\x86\x921000           16\xe2\x86\x9210000\n12\xe2\x86\x921100       24\xe2\x86\x9211000\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85beast787\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFPROG\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 beast787, binary, bit-manipulation, c-plus-plus, easy-medium, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-01-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
