b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nChef and his friend Yurii decided to meet in the cafe. As they are very busy one would not wait for another too long. Namely, after arriving, Chef will spend at most  t1 seconds waiting for Yurii while Yurii will wait no more than t2 seconds.\nChef can arrive at any moment within [0..T1] with equal probability. Similarly Yurii can arrive at any moment within [0..T2].\nArrival time may be any real number from the interval.\nChef asks you to calculate the probability of meeting his friend Yurii in the cafe.\nInput\nFirst line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. First and the only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x93 T1, T2, t1 and t2.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output one the single real number - probability of meeting Chef and his friend Yurii. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10-6.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T1, T2  \xe2\x89\xa4 109 \n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 t1, t2  \xe2\x89\xa4 109 \n\n\nSubtask 1: (5 points)\n\nt1 = 0 and t2 = 0\n\n\nSubtask 2: (15 points)\n\nt1 = 0 or t2 = 0\n\n\nSubtask 3: (25 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T1, T2 \xe2\x89\xa4 10\nThe answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10-2\n\n\nSubtask 4: (55 points)\n\nOriginal constraints\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2 2 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0.750000\n1.000000\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85antoniuk1\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FRNDMTNG\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Probability, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1988\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-02-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
