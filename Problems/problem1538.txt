b'\nYou have a rooted tree consisting of n vertices. There are some weights on each edge of the tree denoted by Wi. The tree root is a vertex with number 1. \nIn this problem, you need to answer Q queries. Each query is described by three values u, v, and x. It is guaranteed that subtrees of node u and node v are disjoint. You are allowed to add at most one edge of weight x between any node in the subtree of u and any node in the subtree of v. Find the maximum weighted path between u and v given that each node can occur only once in a path.\nA subtree of some vertex is a subgraph containing that vertex and all its descendants.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nFirst line of each testcase will contain N and Q, number of nodes and queries respectively.\nNext N \xe2\x88\x92 1 lines contain three integers u, v and Wi representing an edge between nodes u and v of weight Wi.\nThe next Q lines contain three integers u, v and x as explained in the problem statement.\n\nOutput:\nFor each query, output in a single line the maximum weighted path.\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n,q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x97105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4abs(Wi),x\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\n\n20 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4n,q\xe2\x89\xa41000\n80 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4n,q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x97105\n\nSample Input:\n1\n7 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 -2\n2 4 3\n2 5 -4\n5 7 5\n3 6 6\n2 3 1\n5 4 2\n5 6 0\n\nSample Output:\n10\n7\n5\n\nExplanation:\n\nQuery 1 : Its  optimal to add a edge between nodes 4 and 6 making a path 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 3  with a weight of 3 + 1 + 6 = 10.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85aman_robotics\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TREEDGE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 akashbhalotia, aman_robotics, binary-lifting, dynamic-programming, ico, icop1904, lowest-common-ancestor, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-01-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
