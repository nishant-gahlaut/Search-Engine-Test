b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nJames has a board (a two-dimensional plane) with NN nails sticking out of it and a rubber band tangled up between these nails. The rubber band can be viewed as a closed curve made up of MM line segments (a closed polyline with MM vertices). None of the nails intersect the rubber band, but the rubber band may intersect itself.\nJames wants to move the rubber band away from the nails. Specifically, the rubber band is removed if there is a line which does not intersect the rubber band or any of the nails and splits the board into two half-planes such that one half-plane contains all nails and the other half-plane contains the whole rubber band.\nJames can deform, stretch and shrink the rubber band in any way he wants, as long as it does not intersect with any nail (no point of the rubber band coincides with any nail) at any time during performing the deformations. However, he is not allowed to pick up the rubber band from the board (all deformations must occur in the given 2D plane).\nGiven the positions of the nails and the shape of the rubber band, determine if James will be able to remove the rubber band.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nEach of the following NN lines contains two space-separated real numbers xx and yy denoting the coordinates of one nail.\nThe next line contains a single integer MM.\nEach of the following MM lines contains two space-separated real numbers xx and yy denoting the coordinates of one vertex of the polyline. The rubber band is formed by connecting each pair of consecutive vertices by a line segment and connecting the first and last vertex by a line segment.\n\nAll real numbers on the input are given with up to 6 decimal digits.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if James can remove the rubber band or "NO" if he can not (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n3\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa43,0003\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa43,000\n|x|,|y|\xe2\x89\xa4100|x|,|y|\xe2\x89\xa4100\nit is guaranteed that the distance of any point on the rubber band from any nail is at least 10\xe2\x88\x92410\xe2\x88\x924\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): time limit 1 second\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa410N\xe2\x89\xa410\nM\xe2\x89\xa420M\xe2\x89\xa420\n\nSubtask #2 (90 points): time limit 5 seconds, original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n90 90\n3\n0 0\n10 0\n5 5\n1\n0.6 0\n6\n-2 2\n2 -1\n-1 1\n-1 -1\n2 1\n-2 -2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The rubber band is already separated from the only nail at position (90,90)(90,90).\nExample case 2: The input corresponds to the image below.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\njcpaik\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RUBBER\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 geometry, hard, homotopic, jcpaik, may18, stack\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2869\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-05-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
