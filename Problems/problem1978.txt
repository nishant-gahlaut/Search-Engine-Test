b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin and Russian. Translations in Vietnamese to be uploaded soon.\nToday, you finally have a chance to compete with a famous coder like Vasia and prove your mettle.\nWhile he likes the real world as well, his adventures in 3D computer puzzles make him the undisputed King of the subject. Until now, that is!\nVasia has N distinct points in 3 dimensional space and he is going to ask you to find the following sum Q times.\n\nWhere A,B,C and D are some evil integers chosen by Vasia, and their values vary for each summation query.\nInput\n\nFirst line contains two integers N and Q. N is number of points, and Q is number of queries.\nThe next N lines contain integer point coordinates Xi, Yi, Zi.\nThe last Q lines contain a query each in the form of 4 integers A, B, C, D.\nNote that all the integers in a single line are separated by single spaces.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, output a single line containing the sum accurate up to 10-6.\nConstraints\n\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 777777\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 77\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Xi, Yi, Zi \xe2\x89\xa4 77\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai, Bi, Ci \xe2\x89\xa4 77\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Di \xe2\x89\xa4 7777\nP.S.
