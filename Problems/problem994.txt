b'\nChef took part in a race event ,in which the length of racing track is NN miles.\nHowever there are checkpoints at an interval of KK miles from the starting point onward,\ni.e at the distance of K,2K,3K...K,2K,3K... from the starting point.\nOn reaching each checkpoint Chef has to return back to the starting point to restart his race, and the visited checkpoint is removed. \nChef is busy preparing himself for the race,so he wants you to find out the total distance \nhe has to cover in order to complete the race successfully. The race is said to be successfully completed if all the checkpoints at a distance dd (d\xe2\x89\xa4N)(d\xe2\x89\xa4N) is removed.\nThe result can be very large, so compute it modulo 1000000007 (109+7109+7)\nInput:\n\nFirst line contains  TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \nEach test case contains  two space separated integers NN and KK\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output in a single line answer i.e total distance chef needs to cover to complete his race modulo 1000000007.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4251\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa425\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410121\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41012\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSample Input:\n2\n3 2\n4 2\n\nSample Output:\n7\n16\n\nEXPLANATION:\nIn 1st1st case : N=3N=3 and K=2K=2 ,therefore there is only one checkpoint in the racing track. So\n        Chef runs 2 miles and reaches the checkpoint. From here he has to return back \n        to starting point i.e 2 miles. Now as there are no more checkpoints yet to be reached so\n        he can cover the remaining distance i.e. 3 miles in a go. So total distance is 2+2+3=7miles2+2+3=7miles.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85shrivas7\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ENOC4\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 arithmetic-progression, easy, enoc2019, modular-arith, shrivas7\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-10-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
