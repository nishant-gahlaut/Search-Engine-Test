b"\n\nThis problem is simple. You will be given an integer  N  and you need to factorize that number. To help you with factorization of  N , you will also be given  phi(N) . \n\n phi(x)  is also known as Euler's Totient  function.\n phi(x)  is defined as number of positive integers less than or equal to x which are relatively prime to  x  (i.e, greatest common divisor is 1).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains two space separated integers representing N and  phi(N)  respectively. N  denotes the number to be factorized.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the prime factors of  N  in non decreasing order. See example for clarity.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 20\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1018)\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n8 4\n36 12\n450 120\n\nOutput:\n2 2 2\n2 2 3 3\n2 3 3 5 5\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85triveni\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 hard, mpc, mpc2, number-theory, triveni\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-01-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
