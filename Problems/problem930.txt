b'\nHave you ever implemented a program adding two big integers that cannot be represented by the primitive data type of your programming language? The algorithm is just simulation of the column addition method that we have been taught in elementary school. Sometimes we forget the carry and the result is incorrect. \n In this problem, you need to evaluate the expected value of the number of times we have non-zero carry when adding two non-negative integers that contain at most N digits each. Note that we are adding the numbers in their base 10 representation.\n\nFor example, the following table shows the number of carries when adding some pairs of numbers: \nA\nB\nNumber of carries\n20\n4\n0\n111\n119\n1\n123\n923\n1\n1235\n98765\n5\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. \nEach test case has a single line containing an integer N.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the required expected value. \nYour answer will be accepted if the error is less than 10 -6.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100,000(105)\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100,000(105)\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1\n2\n3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0.45\n0.945\n1.4445\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.\nWe have 10*10 = 100 cases of adding two 1-digit number.\nThe carry appears when adding 1 and 9, 2 and 9, 3 and 9 ... and so on, \nthere are 45 cases in total and in each case, the carry appears exactly once.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ntuan_adm\n\n\nTester:\n4\xe2\x98\x85keshav_57\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TAAPLUSB\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DP Approach\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1796\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-05-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
