b"\nNow that Chef has streamlined his cupcake baking procedure,\nhe's turning his attention toward frosting the cupcakes.\nHe recently purchased a machine that produces frosting.\nEach cupcake requires one unit of frosting, and the frosting machine\nrequires K2 units of energy to produce K units of frosting\nin one minute (K need not be an integer).\nCupcakes arrive in batches, once per minute, needing frosting.\nThe cupcakes must be frosted within a minute of when they arrive.\nThe frosting machine also has a reserve unit, so it can produce extra frosting\nto be used later.\nThe reserve unit has a capacity of S units of frosting, and is initially empty.\nThe machine may produce more units of frosting than is currently demanded, and\nthe excess will be added to the reserve unit.\nOr, the machine can produce fewer units of frosting than is currently demanded,\ndrawing the remainder of what is needed from the reserve.\nAt all times the reserve unit must have between 0 and S units of frosting.\n\nChef has a schedule ahead of time of exactly how many cupcakes\nwill arrive each minute needing frosting, and can create a frosting production schedule for the machine that will optimize its energy usage.  The machine may produce a different amount of frosting each minute.\nGiven the cupcake schedule, calculate the minimum energy needed to frost all\nthe cupcakes divided by the total number of cupcakes.\nInput\nInput will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases.\nEach test case begins with 2 integers N and S on a line, representing\nthe number of minutes the machine will operate, and the capacity of the\nstorage unit, respectively.\nFollowing is a line with N space-separated integers C0...CN-1,\nwhere Ci is the number of cupcakes arriving at time i.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output on a single line the minimum total energy consumption\nof the machine divided by the total number of cupcakes, rounded to 5 places after the decimal point.\nSample input\n4\n5 0\n1 2 3 4 5\n5 1\n0 0 0 0 2\n5 2\n0 0 0 0 2\n5 2\n2 0 0 0 0\n\nSample output\n3.66667\n0.62500\n0.40000\n2.00000\n\nConstraints\nT<50\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa430000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa430000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa420000\nAt least one Ci will be non-zero\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndavid_adm\n\n\nTester:\nfriggstad\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MUFFINS2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cook09, david_adm, hard\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n9999\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-03-2011\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.3625 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
