b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nIn computer science, a treap is a binary search tree according to the keys and meanwhile a heap according to the weights. Follow the link for more details: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treap\nYour task is to maintain a max-treap supporting the following operations:\n\n0 k w: Insert a new node, whose key and weight are k and w.\n1 k: Delete a node in the treap with key k.\n2 ku kv: Return the distance between node\xc2\xa0u whose key is ku and node\xc2\xa0v whose key is kv.\n\n\nNo two nodes share the same key or the same weight in the tree, and we guarantee the node is indeed in the treap before a delete operation takes place.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains an integer N, the number of operations. \nEach of the next N lines contains two or three integers "0 k w" "1 k" or "2 ku kv\xe2\x80\x9d . These integers describe the current operation.\n\nOutput\nFor each distance query, print the distance between u and v.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 200000\n0 < k, w, ku, kv  < 232\n\nExample\nInput:\n12\n0 4 17535\n0 10 38964\n0 2 21626\n0 1 61321\n2 1 10\n2 10 4 \n1 10\n1 1\n0 8 42634\n2 8 4\n2 8 2\n2 4 2\n\nOutput:\n1\n2\n2\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85xiaodao\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85laycurse\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COT5\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Treap, Segment Trees, Square Root Decomposition\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Advanced Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3032\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-12-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
