b"\n\nTomya is a girl. She loves Chef Ciel very much.\n\n\nTomya writes a tetragon (see the below Notes 1 for details) in her map.\nThe map has N points, whose coordinate are (Xi, Yi), denoting Ciel's restaurants.\nEach vertex of the tetragon written by Tomya is one of the Ciel's restaurants.\n\n\nTomya doesn't show her tetragon in the map, but she says that she draws a long segment.\nTo guess her tetragon, please tell the maximum length of a segment which can be one of the sides in her tetragon. (See Notes 2 for the definition of length)\n\n\nNotes 1:\nA tetragon means a polygon with 4 sides.\nA tetragon must be simple, that is, the boundary of the tetragon does not cross itself.\nA tetragon does not have to be convex.\n\nNotes 2:\nThe length of a segment is defined as the Euclidean distance between the endpoints.\nThat is, the length of the segment (x1, y1) - (x2, y2) is the square root of (x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.\nThen T test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integers N.\nThen next N lines follow.\nThe i-th line contains 2 integers denoting Xi and Yi.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print the maximum length of a segment which can be one of sides in her tetragon.\nThis value must have an absolute error no more than 0.000001 (10-6).\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 1250\n4 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Xi, Yi \xe2\x89\xa4 5000\nThe sum of N in one test file does not exceed 5000.\nNo three points (Xi, Yi), (Xj, Yj), (Xk, Yk) lie in the same line (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i < j < k \xe2\x89\xa4 N)\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n6\n3 1\n5 2\n3 3\n6 3\n6 6\n5 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5.8309518948\n\n\nExplanation\n\nThe below figure denotes one of the valid tetragons for the sample input.\nThe red segment is the longest segment which can be one of the sides in her tetragon.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nhiroto_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CIELMAP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Cartesian Coordinate System, Cross Product, Intersection, Pigeonhole Principle, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Mathematics, Computational Geometry, Set Theory, Lines, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2084\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-07-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.367347 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nJAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, LISP clisp, SCM guile, ERL, CLPS, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
