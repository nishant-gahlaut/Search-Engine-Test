Its edges are numbered 1 through N\xe2\x88\x921. For each valid i, there is an integer ai written on the i-th vertex. Also, for each valid i, there is an integer bi written on the i-th edge.\nYou want the following condition to be satisfied: for each vertex v and each edge e adjacent to v, av\xe2\x89\xa5be. In order to achieve that, you may perform an arbitrary number of steps (including zero). In one step, you may perform one the following operations:\n\nSelect two different vertices u and v. Swap au and av.\nSelect two different edges e and f. Swap be and bf.\nSelect a vertex v and an integer x. Change av to x and pay one coin.\n\nCalculate the minimum number of coins you need in order to satisfy the required condition.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nN\xe2\x88\x921 lines follow. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x921), the i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers ui, vi and bi denoting that the i-th edge connects vertices ui and vi and the initial value written on it is bi.\nThe last line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum necessary number of coins.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nthe graph on the input is a tree\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa47\nSubtask #2 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa410\nSubtask #3 (30 points): N\xe2\x89\xa4200\nSubtask #4 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3\n1 2 4\n2 3 7\n1 5 10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: There is no way to satisfy the required condition without paying any coins. When we have one coin, we can perform the following operations:\n\nSwap the integers written on vertices 1 and 2.\nPay one coin and change the integer written on vertex 2 to 7.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85saboon\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/STICNOT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Multiset, Greedy, Sorting, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Sets, Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2258\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-10-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
