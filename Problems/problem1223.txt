b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nThere is a castle which can be described as an undirected tree with NN vertices and N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 edges. Each edge has a magic number C.\nWhen a group of tourists visit the castle, they are interested in a path between vertices U and V. They think that an edge is interesting if its magic number is \xe2\x89\xa4K. The total attractiveness of the path is the xor of all interesting edges on it.\nGiven M groups of tourists, find the total attractiveness of the path for each group.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test case descriptions follow. \nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N, denoting the number of vertices.\nThe next N\xe2\x88\x921 lines each contain three integers U, V and C, which denote an edge between vertices U and V with magical number C.\nThe next line contains a single integer M, which denotes the number of requests.\nThe next M lines contain information about the requests. Each line contains three integers U, V and K.\n\nOutput\nFor each request output a single integer in a separate line - the total attractiveness of the path.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4U,V\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4C,K\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks :\n\nSubtask 1: (10 points) 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa410\nSubtask 2: (20 points) 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4103\nSubtask 3: (70 points) 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n1 2 1\n2 3 2 \n2 4 5\n3 5 10\n6\n5 4 5\n5 4 10\n5 4 1\n1 2 1\n4 1 10\n1 5 8\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n7\n13\n0\n1\n4\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85fekete\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PSHTTR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, Lowest Common Ancestor, DFS Order, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals, DFS\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2225\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-03-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
