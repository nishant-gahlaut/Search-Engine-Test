Now, it is not winter anymore, so here is the formal statement instead:\nYou are given a connected graph with NN nodes and MM edges. You are given Q queries of the following types:\n\n1 u: Given node u (1\xe2\x89\xa4u\xe2\x89\xa4N), set the state of the node u to frozen.\n2 t: Given t, let t units of time pass by.\n3 v: Given node v (1\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa4N), answer if node v is currently frozen.\n\nInitially, no node is frozen.\nThe graph has the following property:\n\nIf, at time T, a node u is frozen, then, at time (T+1), all neighbours of u become frozen.\n\nFor each query of type 3, answer whether the node is currently frozen. \nNote:\n\nIf a node is already frozen, it remains unaffected after a type 1 query.\nIf, for a frozen node u, a neighbour v of node u is frozen at time T, node v remains unaffected at time (T+1).\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains three integers N,M, and Q.\nM lines follow, the ith of which contains two integers ui and vi, representing there is an edge between nodes ui and vi.\nThen, Q lines follow, the jth of which contains two integers typej and xj.\nIf typej is 1 or 2, it indicates that you must effectuate an update of the type typej with parameter xj. Otherwise, answer the query with parameter xj\n\nOutput Format\nFor each query of type 3, print YES if the queried node is frozen. Otherwise, print NO. \nYou may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YeS, yEs, yes and YES will all be treated as identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4typej\xe2\x89\xa43\n1\xe2\x89\xa4xj\xe2\x89\xa4N, if the query type is 1 or 3.\n1\xe2\x89\xa4xj\xe2\x89\xa4109, if the query type is 2.\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (10 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000,1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa42000,1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa43000.\nSubtask 2 (30 points): Each node in the given graph has at most two neighbours.   \nSubtask 3 (60 points): Original constraints.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n6 6 6\n1 2\n2 3\n4 1\n5 4\n6 1\n6 5\n1 1\n3 1\n1 5\n2 1\n3 4\n3 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: The graph looks like:\n\n\nQuery 1: Freeze the node 1. The graph looks like:\n\nQuery 2: Find the status of node 1. Since node 1 is frozen, we print YES.\nQuery 3: Freeze the node 5. The graph looks like:\n\nQuery 4: 1 unit of time passes. Before this, nodes 1 and 5 were frozen.\nAfter 1 second, all the neighbours of node 1, i.e., nodes 2,4, and 6, and all the neighbours of node 5, i.e., nodes 4 and 6 are frozen.\nThus, after this query, the frozen nodes in the graph are 1,2,4,5, and 6. The graph looks like:\n\nQuery 5: Find the status of node 4. Since node 4 is frozen, we print YES.\nQuery 6: Find the status of node 3. Since node 3 is not frozen, we print NO.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nkinto\n\n\nTester:\n5\xe2\x98\x85mexomerf\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ELWINTER\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Queues, Graphs\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2007\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-03-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.4 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
