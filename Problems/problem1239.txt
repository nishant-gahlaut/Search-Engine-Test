b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nAfter failing to clear his school mathematics examination, infinitepro decided to prepare very hard for his upcoming re-exam, starting with the topic he is weakest at \xe2\x80\x95 computational geometry.\nBeing an artist, infinitepro has C pencils (numbered 1 through C); each of them draws with one of C distinct colours. He draws N lines (numbered 1 through N) in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system; for each valid i, the i-th line is drawn with the ci-th pencil and it is described by the equation y=ai\xe2\x8b\x85x+bi.\nNow, infinitepro calls a triangle truly-geometric if each of its sides is part of some line he drew and all three sides have the same colour. He wants to count these triangles, but there are too many of them! After a lot of consideration, he decided to erase a subset of the N lines he drew. He wants to do it with his eraser, which has length K.\nWhenever erasing a line with a colour i, the length of the eraser decreases by Vi. In other words, when the eraser has length k and we use it to erase a line with a colour i, the length of the eraser decreases to k\xe2\x88\x92Vi; if k<Vi, it is impossible to erase such a line.\nSince infinitepro has to study for the re-exam, he wants to minimise the number of truly-geometric triangles. Can you help him find the minimum possible number of truly-geometric triangles which can be obtained by erasing a subset of the N lines in an optimal way? He promised a grand treat for you if he passes the examination!\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers N, C and K.\nN lines follow. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci.\nThe last line contains C space-separated integers V1,V2,\xe2\x80\xa6,VC.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest possible number of truly-geometric triangles after erasing lines.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4C\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43,000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa43,000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4C for each valid i\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Vi\xe2\x89\xa4K for each valid i\nno two lines coincide, regardless of their colours\nno three lines are concurrent\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa410\nK\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\nSubtask 2 (15 points):\n\nV1=V2=\xe2\x80\xa6=VC\nno two lines are parallel\n\nSubtask #3 (25 points): no two lines are parallel\nSubtask #4 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n7 2 13\n1 10 1\n1 14 2\n6 4 1\n2 2 1\n0 12 2\n2 11 2\n0 6 1\n8 10\n6 1 20\n1 5 1\n2 11 1\n4 0 1\n6 8 1\n0 11 1\n3 3 1\n9\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: We can remove exactly one line. Initially, we have 5 truly geometric triangles (see the image below; red is colour 1 and green is colour 2).\n\nRemoving any line with colour 2 brings the total number of truly-geometric triangles down to 4+0=4.\nRemoving any line with colour 1 brings the total number of truly-geometric triangles down to 1+1=2.\n\nThus, the smallest number of truly-geometric triangles we can obtain is 2.\n\nExample case 2: We can remove at most 2 lines and removing any 2 lines gives us a total of 4 truly-geometric triangles.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85infinitepro\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ACCBIP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Geometry, Dynamic Programming, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2423\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-04-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
