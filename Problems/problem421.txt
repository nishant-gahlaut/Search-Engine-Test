b'\nGiven an array A of length N, your task is to find the element which repeats in A maximum number of times as well as the corresponding count. In case of ties, choose the smaller element first.\n\n\nInput\nFirst line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then follows description of T cases. Each case begins with a single integer N, the length of A. Then follow N space separated integers in next line.  Assume that 1 <= T <= 100, 1 <= N <= 100 and for all i in [1..N] : 1 <= A[i] <= 10000\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output two space separated integers V & C. V is the value which occurs maximum number of times and C is its count.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5\n1 2 3 2 5\n6\n1 2 2 1 1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2 2\n1 3\n\n\nExplanation\nIn first case 2 occurs twice whereas all other elements occur only once. \nIn second case, both 1 and 2 occur 3 times but 1 is smaller than 2.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85nikhil_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85anton_lunyov\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MAXCOUNT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, feb12, nikhil_adm\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1180\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-01-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.207865 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
