b'\nAlice and Bob are playing a game on a binary string SS of length N.\nAlice and Bob alternate turns, with Alice going first. On their turn, the current player must choose any index 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<|S| such that Si\xe2\x89\xa0Si+1 and erase either Si or Si+1 from the string. This reduces the length of S by one, and the remaining parts of S are concatenated in the same order.\nThe player who is unable to make a move loses.\nDetermine the winner if both players play optimally.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N, the length of the string.\nThe second line contains the binary string S of length N.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case output Alice if Alice wins the game, otherwise output Bob.\nThe output is not case-sensitive, so for example "Bob", "boB" and "Bob" are all considered equivalent.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nS is a binary string\nSum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n4\n1111\n3\n110\n4\n1010\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nBob\nAlice\nBob\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: There is no such index i such that Si\xe2\x89\xa0Si+1. So, Alice does not have any move and loses, making Bob the winner.\nTest Case 2: Alice can choose i=2 (because S2=1 and S3=0) and remove S3. After this move, the remaining string is "11". Bob now has no moves and thus loses.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nutkarsh_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/STRADJ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, Case work, Game Theory\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Special, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2080\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-11-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
