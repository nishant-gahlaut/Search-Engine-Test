b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nMasha has NN minions. Each minion has two characteristics: power a and endurance b. Masha thinks that a non-empty set of minions {m1,m2,\xe2\x80\xa6,mk} with characteristics (am1,bm1),(am2,bm2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(amk,bmk) is good if the mean endurance of this set doesn't exceed the minimum power in it, i.e. if min(am1,am2,\xe2\x80\xa6,amk)\xe2\x89\xa5(bm1+bm2+\xe2\x8b\xaf+bmk)/k.\nMasha would like to choose a good subset of her minions and give these minions to Mark. Your task is to calculate the maximum number of minions Masha can give to Mark.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe following N lines describe minions. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers a and b denoting the power and endurance of one minion.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one number \xe2\x80\x94 the size of the largest good set of minions, or 0 if no such set exists.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa44\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4109\nthe sum of N for all test cases does not exceed 4\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n1 4\n3 3\n2 1\n2\n3 5\n1 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The set of minions {2,3} is good, since min(3,2)\xe2\x89\xa5(3+1)/2.\nExample case 2: There is no non-empty good subset of minions.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85barenuz\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MINIONS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Segment Trees, Square Root Decomposition, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2466\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-06-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
