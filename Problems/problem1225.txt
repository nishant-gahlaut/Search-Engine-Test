One day, he found a new problem which he finds difficult to solve. Therefore, he's asking for your help!\nYou are given a sequence A1, A2, ..., AN and Q queries. There are two types of queries:\n\n1 X Y \xe2\x80\x94 Set AX = Y.\n2 L R G \xe2\x80\x94 Compute the number of indices i such that L \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 R and gcd(G, Ai) = 1.\n\n\nFind the answer to each query of the second type.\n\n\nNote: gcd(X, Y) denotes the greatest common divisor \xe2\x80\x94 the highest positive integer which divides both X and Y.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer N denoting the number of elements in the sequence.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.\nThe third line contains a single integer Q denoting the number of queries.\nEach of the following Q lines describes one query in the following format:\n\n1 X Y for a query of the first type\n2 L R G for a query of the second type\n\n\n\nOutput\nFor each query of type 2, print a single line containing one integer - the answer to the query.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, Q \xe2\x89\xa4 5 \xc2\xb7 104\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 L \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 X \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Y, G \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 105 for each valid i\n\nSubtasks  \nSubtask #1 (15 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, Q \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\nSubtask #2 (85 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n2 3 4 5\n3\n2 1 4 2\n1 2 6\n2 1 4 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the first query, gcd(A2, 2) = 1 and gcd(A4, 2) = 1, so the answer is 2.\nIn the third query, only gcd(A4, 2) is equal to 1, so the answer is 1.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85vipsharmavip\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GCDCNT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Segment Trees, Square Root Decomposition, Divisors, Inclusion Exclusion Principle, Mobius Inversion\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Mathematics, Number Theory, Set Theory, Integer Factorisation\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2002\n\n\nDate Added:\n31-01-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
