b'\nAn index ii in a permutation P of length N is said to be good if:\n\nPi is divisible by i\n\nYou are given 2 integers N and K. You need to construct a permutation P of length N such that exactly K indices in that permutation are good.\nIf no such permutation exists, output \xe2\x88\x921.\nIf multiple such permutations exist, output any.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers N and K - the length of the permutation to be constructed and the number of good indices.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output any permutation satisfying the given condition.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\nSum of N over all testcases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1 1\n6 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4 5 6 1 2 3\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case-1: In [1], P1=1 is divisible by 1. Therefore it is a valid permutation having 1 good index.\nTest case-2: In [4,5,6,1,2,3], P1=4 is divisible by 1 and P3=6 is divisible by 3. Therefore it is a valid permutation having 2 good indices.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85munch_01\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PERFPERM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 constructive, cook138, easy, munch_01\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1696\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-02-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
