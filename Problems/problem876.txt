b'\nYou are given a number X. You have to make this number divisible by 2. The operations you can perform is as follows:\n\xe2\xa6\x81    Add 1 to X\n\xe2\xa6\x81    Substract 1 from X\nYou can perform these operations zero or more no of times. You have to find the minimum number of operations required to make X divisible by 2.  \nInput:\nt: Number of test cases\nX: the given number  \nOutput:\nThe minimum number of operations required to make X divisible by 2  \nConstraints:\n1<=t<=1000\n0<=X<=10^9  \nSample Input:\n2\n4\n0  \nSample Output:\n0\n0  \nExplanation:\nSince 4 is divisible by 2 so the number of operation will be 0  \nSince 0 is divisible by 2 so the number of operation will be 0  \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85carpe_diemist\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MINOPER\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 c-plus-plus, carpe_diemist, easy, number-theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-01-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
