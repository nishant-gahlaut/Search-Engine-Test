b"\nRecently ZennyZenny read about Array and now she is cracking Array's questions. She told about this to his friend Zen .Zen wants to check how much Zenny know about Array .So, he  has given her  an array of integers  of size N . Zenny\xe2\x80\xb2s task is to find out the sum of all distinct positive integer and distinct negative integers in  the given array . As Zenny is beginner in problem solving so she is looking for your help. \nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain T, the number of testcases. \nEach testcase contains of two  lines  first line  contains    N  size of array and \nthe second line contains N space-separated integers.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line  containing  S1  and S2 where S1 and S2 are sum of distinct positive integers and sum of distinct negative integers respectively. Sum will not be greater than 10^9 and will not be less than -10^9.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\xe2\x88\x92106\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\nSample Input:\n2\n5\n-1 1 -1 0 -2\n6\n4 5 3 3 -1 -2\nSample Output:\n1  -3\n12  -3\nEXPLANATION:\nCase 1:- Distinct positive integers are  1,0   and distinct negative integers are -1,-2\n                sum of positive integers S1 is 1+0=1 and sum of negative integers S2 is (-1+(-2))=-3.\n               So, output is  1  -3.\nCase 2:- Distinct positive integers are  4,5,3  and distinct negative integers are -1,-2\n                sum of positive integers S1 is 4+5+3=12  and sum of negative integers  S2 is (-1+ \n               (-2))=-3.So, output is  12  -3.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85aliencoder_07\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SIPM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 aliencoder_07, array, c-plus-plus, czen2020, easy, implementation, set\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-09-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
