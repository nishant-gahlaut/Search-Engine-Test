b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has permutation P consisting of first N numbers, (i.e. from 1 to N). He wants to sort it, but he doesn't know any type of sort, except Bogosort . Chef is afraid that Bogosort might take a lot of time, so he optimized that algorithm and called it Chefsort. But he doesn't know expected time complexity of this algorithm. Formally, he wants to find expected value of findSwaps function. Please help him to find it. Below is the pseudo code of Chefsort.\n\n\nfunction findSwaps(permutation P) {\n\tswaps = 0;\n\tWHILE (not sorted P) {\n\t\t(i, j) = random pair (1 <= i < j <= n)\n\t\tSWAP(P[i], P[j])\n\t\tswaps = swaps + 1;\n\t}\n\treturn swaps;\n}\n\n\nInput\nFirst line of the input contains one integer T, denoting number of tests. T test case follow. \nFor each test case, first line contains one integer N, denoting number of elements in the permutation.\nSecond line contains N space separated integers denoting the permutation P\nOutput\nOutput a single real number corresponding to expected number of swap operations in Chefsort. Answer will be correct if absolute error less than 10-2.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Pi \xe2\x89\xa4 N \n\nExample\nInput:\n4\n2\n2 1\n3\n2 1 3\n4\n2 3 4 1\n6\n2 5 1 3 4 6\n\nOutput:\n1.0000000\n5.0000000\n27.5000000\n781.0416667\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85karanaggarwal\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFONM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Expected Value, Gaussian Elimination\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Probability, Matrices\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2924\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-07-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
