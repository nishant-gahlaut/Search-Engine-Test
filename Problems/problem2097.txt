b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nAlice and Bob are playing a game.\nFirst, Alice throws NN darts at a board with dimensions 109\xc3\x97109109\xc3\x97109 at random. Each dart hits the board at a point (some of these points may coincide). Then, Bob should answer Alice's QQ questions. In each question, Alice chooses two integers ll and rr; Bob should only consider all points hit in throws ll through rr (inclusive) and compute the distance between the farthest pair of these points.\nHelp Bob find the answers to all queries.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer NN denoting the number of points.\nNN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers xixi and yiyi denoting the coordinates of the point hit with the ii-th dart.\nThe next line contains a single integer QQ denoting the number of queries.\nEach of the following QQ lines contains two space-separated integers ll and rr describing one query.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the square of the maximum distance. (It is guaranteed that this number is an integer.)\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa450,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa450,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each ii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa42001\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4200\nSubtask #2 (30 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa420001\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa42000\nSubtask #3 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1 1\n2 2\n1\n1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85gainullinildar\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DARTSEGM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Segment Trees, Computational Geometry, Convex Hull\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Polygons\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2854\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-04-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
