b'\nSachin has a rectangular Sheet of paper for his regular rough work. Sachin comes to know that he will get more space to do rough work if he cuts the rectangular sheets into square shapes.\nSo keeping this in mind, he decides to divide his rectangular sheet into minimum possible number of square sheet papers, such that each square sheet has the same area, and the square sheets divide the rectangular one perfectly.\nSo your task is to find the minimum number of square sheets with the same area, that can be formed out of the rectangular sheet, such that they divide it perfectly.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers L,BL,B i.e (length & breadth). \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line answer containing the minimum number of square sheets that can be formed from above condition.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4100001\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa410000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4B\xe2\x89\xa4100001\xe2\x89\xa4B\xe2\x89\xa410000\n\nSample Input:\n2\n4 6\n\n10 15\nSample Output:\n6\n\n6\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85abhi_3568\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/KRAFT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 abhi_3568, easy\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-05-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
