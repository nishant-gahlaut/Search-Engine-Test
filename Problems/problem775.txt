b"\nChef received an array AA of N integers as a valentine's day present. He wants to maximize the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence by choosing a subarray and adding a fixed integer X to all its elements.\nMore formally, Chef wants to maximize the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence of A by performing the following operation at most once:\n\nPick 3 integers L,R and X\xc2\xa0(1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N,\xc2\xa0X\xe2\x88\x88Z) and assign Ai:=Ai+X\xc2\xa0\xe2\x88\x80\xc2\xa0i\xe2\x88\x88[L,R].\n\nFind the length of the longest strictly increasing sequence Chef can obtain after performing the operation at most once.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer N, the size of the array.\nThe next line contains N space-separated integers, where the ith integer denotes Ai.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the length of the longest strictly increasing sequence Chef can obtain.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xc3\x97105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\nSum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n1 2 1\n5\n1 5 8 6 9\n4\n1 2 2 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n5\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: Chef can pick (L,R,X)=(3,3,2). On performing the operation, A becomes [1,2,3]. The LIS of the updated array has length 3. The elements of the LIS are [1,2,3].\nTest case 2: Chef can pick (L,R,X)=(2,3,\xe2\x88\x923). On performing the operation, A becomes [1,2,5,6,9]. The LIS of the updated array has length 5. The elements of the LIS are [1,2,5,6,9].\nTest case 3: Chef can pick (L,R,X)=(4,4,4). On performing the operation, A becomes [1,2,2,5]. The LIS of the updated array has length 3. The elements of the LIS are [1,2,5].\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85youknow_who\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MLIS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Data Structures, DP on sequences, Longest Increasing Subsequence, Greedy\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2079\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-03-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
