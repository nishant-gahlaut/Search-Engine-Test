b"\nAlice is teaching Bob maths via a game called NN-guesser.\nAlice has a positive integer NN which Bob needs to guess. She gives him two pieces of information with which to do this:\n\nA positive integer XX, which denotes the sum of divisors of NN.\nTwo positive integers AA and BB, which denote that the sum of reciprocals of divisors of NN is A/BA/B.\n\nBob either needs to guess NN or tell that no such number exists.\nIt can be shown that if a valid NN exists, it is unique.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nEach test case consists of a single line of input, containing three space-separated integers X,A,BX,A,B.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output a new line containing the answer \xe2\x80\x94 Alice's number NN, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if no such number exists.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa4109\ngcd(A,B)=1gcd(A,B)=1\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4 4 3\n4 1 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: The divisors of 33 are 11 and 33. Their sum is 44 and the sum of their reciprocals is 4/34/3.\nTest case 22: It can be proved that no positive integer NN exists whose divisors sum to 44 and reciprocals of divisors sum to 11.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85harsh2511\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DIVREC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, harsh2511, number-theory, start24\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1848\n\n\nDate Added:\n31-01-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
