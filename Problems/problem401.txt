b"\nThe chef has a recipe he wishes to use for his guests,\nbut the recipe will make far more food than he can serve to the guests.\nThe chef therefore would like to make a reduced version of the recipe which has the same ratios of ingredients, but makes less food.\nThe chef, however, does not like fractions.\nThe original recipe contains only whole numbers of ingredients,\nand the chef wants the reduced recipe to only contain whole numbers of ingredients as well.\nHelp the chef determine how much of each ingredient to use in order to make as little food as possible.\nInput\nInput will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of a single line.\nThe line begins with a positive integer N, the number of ingredients.\nN integers follow, each indicating the quantity of a particular ingredient that is used.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output exactly N space-separated integers on a line,\ngiving the quantity of each ingredient that the chef should use in order to make as little food as possible.\nConstraints\nT \xe2\x89\xa4 100 \n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 50\nAll ingredient quantities are between 1 and 1000, inclusive.\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 4 4\n3 2 3 4\n4 3 15 9 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 1\n2 3 4\n1 5 3 2\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndavid_adm\n\n\nTester:\nfriggstad\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RECIPE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 GCD, Euclid's Algorithm, Arithmetic\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Basic Maths\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1047\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-11-2010\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.278837 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
