b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nSereja has two strings s and w. Sereja can do 3 types of operations: \n\nRemove any character from the first string, this operation takes a minutes of time\nAdd any character in any position of the first string, this operation takes a minutes of time\nReplace some character form first string by some other character, this operation takes b minutes of time\n\nSereja has k minutes to do some operations. Find the minimum time that Sereja needs to transform the first string to the second.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n\nThe first line contains string s. The second line contains string w. Both strings contain only lowercase Latin letters. The third line contains integers a,b and k, separated by spaces.\nOutput\nFor each test case on different lines print the answer to the problem - minimum time required to transform the first string to the second by the operations of the first, second and third types. If you can not transform the first string to the second for the specified time, print -1.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |s|, |w| \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 a, b, k \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n\nExample\nInput:\n4\naaa\nbbbb\n0 0 100\nabab\nacac\n1 1 100\nbaaaaa\naaaaab\n1 100 100\naaaaaa\nbbbbbb\n100 100 0\n\nOutput:\n0\n2\n2\n-1\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsereja_adm\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85shangjingbo\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SEATSR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Levenshtein Distance\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, DP on sequences\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2304\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-06-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
