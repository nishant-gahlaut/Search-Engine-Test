b"\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a sequence of positive integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN and a fraction p=x/y. Chef and Chefina play a game on this sequence. They alternate turns; Chef plays first.\nIn each turn, the current player must choose either the first element (with probability p) or the last element (with probability 1\xe2\x88\x92p) of the current sequence and delete that element. The game continues for K turns (e.g. if K=N, it continues until the sequence becomes empty).\nChef wants to know the expected value of the sum of integers he deletes and the expected value of the sum of integers Chefina deletes. It can be proved that each expected sum can be represented as a fraction PQ, where P and Q are non-negative integers and Q is coprime with 998,244,353. You need to compute P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 998,244,353, where Q\xe2\x88\x921 denotes the multiplicative inverse of Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 998,244,353.\nYou need to answer Q queries. In each query, you are given a different value of K.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nThe third line contains two space-separated integers x and y.\nQ lines follow. Each of these lines contains a single integer K describing a query.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing two space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x95 the values of P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 998,244,353 for the expected sums of numbers deleted by Chef and Chefina respectively.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai<998,244,353 for each valid i\n0\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4y<998,244,353\ny>0\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (2 points): N,Q\xe2\x89\xa415\nSubtask #2 (3 points): N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSubtask #3 (5 points): N,Q\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nSubtask #4 (20 points): N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\nSubtask #5 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 2\n3 2 1\n1 2\n1\n2\n1 1\n4\n1 5\n1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2 0\n2 2\n4 0\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: In the first turn, the sequence is A=[3,2,1] and Chef can delete the first or last element with equal probability 12. Therefore, Chef's expected sum for K=1 is 12\xe2\x8b\x853+12\xe2\x8b\x851=2. Also, since Chefina has not done anything yet, her expected sum is 0.\nIn the next turn, Chefina has to choose an element. Since Chef could have chosen 3 or 1 in the first turn, we have 2 possible sequences for Chefina now: [2,1] or [3,2], each with the same probability 12. Chefina's expected sums after this turn individually for these two sequences are 32 and 52 respectively. Therefore, the expected sum of elements deleted by Chefina for K=2 is 12\xe2\x8b\x85(32+52)=2. Also, Chef's expected sum for K=2 is the same as for K=1.\nExample case 2: We have only 1 element, so Chef deletes it in the first turn. The expected sum is 4 for Chef and 0 for Chefina.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85samarth2017\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/QUERGAME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Combinatorics, Expected Value, FFT, NTT\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Probability, Transformations\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-02-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
