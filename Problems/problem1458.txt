b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\n\nMike likes strings. He is also interested in algorithms. A few days ago he discovered for himself a very nice problem:\n\n\nYou are given a digit string S. You need to count the number of substrings of S, which are palindromes.\n\n\nDo you know how to solve it? Good. Mike will make the problem a little bit more difficult for you.\n\n\nYou are given a digit string S. You need to count the number of substrings of S, which are palindromes without leading zeros and can be divided by 3 without a remainder.\n\n\nA string is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. A string is a palindrome without leading zeros if it reads the same backward as forward and doesn\'t start with symbol \'0\'. A string is a digit string, if it doesn\'t contain any symbols except \'0\', \'1\', \'2\', ..., \'9\'.\n\n\nPlease, note that you should consider string "0" as a palindrome without leading zeros.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a digit string S.\nOutput\nYour output should contain the only integer, denoting the number of substrings of S, which are palindromes without leading zeros and can be divided by 3 without a remainder.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4 1 000 000\nExample\nInput:\n1045003\n\nOutput:\n4\n\nExplanation\n\nIn the example you should count S[2..2] = "0", S[5..5] = "0", S[6..6] = "0" and S[7..7] = "3".\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kostya_by\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85gerald\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PALIN3\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, Basic Maths, Manachers Algorithm, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Mathematics, Algorithms, String Algos, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2781\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-02-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
