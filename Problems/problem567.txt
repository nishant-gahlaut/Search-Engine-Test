b'\nFor a permutation PP of length N, we define L(P) to be the length of the longest increasing subsequence in P. That is, L(P) is the largest integer K such that there exist indices i1<i2<\xe2\x80\xa6<iK such that Pi1<Pi2<\xe2\x80\xa6<PiK. \nDefine PR to be the permutation (PN,PN\xe2\x88\x921,\xe2\x80\xa6,P1). \nYou are given a positive integer N. You need to output a permutation P of length N such that L(P)=L(PR), or say that none exist.\nNote: P is said to be a permutation of length N if P is a sequence of length N consisting of N distinct integers between 1 and N. For example, (3,1,2) is a permutation of length 3, but (1,4,2), (2,2,3) and (2,1) are not.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nEach test case consists of a single line containing one integer N \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the permutation to be constructed.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output on a new line "YES" if there exists a valid permutation, and "NO" if there doesn\'t. If you outputted "YES", on the next line, output a valid permutation P as N space-separated integers, the ith of which is Pi.\nYou can print each letter of the string in any case (upper or lower) (for instance, strings YES, yEs, and yes will be considered identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\nThe sum of N across all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2\n3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNO\nYES\n1 3 2\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: There are two permutations of length 2 \xe2\x80\x94 (1,2) and (2,1). The length of the LIS of (1,2) is 2 and the length of the LIS of (2,1) is 1. Since these permutations are reverses of each other and have unequal LIS lengths, there is no valid permutation of length 2.\nTest Case 2: The length of the LIS of (1,3,2) is 2, and the length of the LIS of its reverse, (2,3,1), is also 2. Therefore, this is a valid permutation of length 3.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nutkarsh_adm\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85aryanc403\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EQLIS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, longest-inc-subsequence, start22, utkarsh_adm\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1848\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-01-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
